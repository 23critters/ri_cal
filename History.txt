=== 0.6.1 - 6 June 2009
 * Fixed problem with file which loads activesupport for the rake spec:with_activesupport task, it now
   requires >=2.2 instead of <=2.2 - Thanks to Paul Scott-Murphy for finding this.
=== 0.6.0 - 5 June 2009
 Time for a minor version bump.
 * Improved overall enumeration performance bypassing most of the effects of the poor performance of Ruby's DateTime class.
 * Added a framework for performance monitoring during development.
   - New performance directory with subdirs for code to be monitored for performance (subjects)
   - New script files: 
        script/benchmark_subject runs a ruby benchmark on one performance subject
        script/profile_subject runs ruby-prof for a subject and puts a kcachegrind compatible calltree in the performance_data directory.
   - New rake tasks: 
        performance:benchmark runs benchmarks against all subjects in the performance directory and produces a consolidated output file in performance_data/benchmarks.out
        performance:profile runs script/profile_subject against all subjects in the performance directory.
=== 0.5.3 - 1 June, 2009
 * Improved performance of time zone enumeration, TimeZonePeriod now caches occurrences
 * Added a profiling directory which contains ruby programs which benchmark and/or profile performance
=== 0.5.2

    Missing comparison methods in PropertyValue::Date

    Type of dtstart and dtend (DATE or DATETIME) now preserved on enumeration
=== 0.0.8
  * Fixed http://rick_denatale.lighthouseapp.com/projects/30941-ri_cal/tickets/1
    EXDATE and RDATE now pick up the timezone from DateTime, Time, and TimeWithZone values
  * Fixed http://rick_denatale.lighthouseapp.com/projects/30941/tickets/2
    Missing arithmetic methods in PropertyValue::Date
  * Fixed http://rick_denatale.lighthouseapp.com/projects/30941/tickets/3
       Components with no recurrence rules or rdate properties failed on enumeration, they now
       will enumerate a single occurrence  
=== 0.0.7
 * Fixed a bug relating to properly recognizing ActiveRecord::TimeWithZone
 * DATETIME propertyvalues will now return an instance of TimeWithZone instead of DateTime when
   activesupport is present, and it is appropriate. See the README for details
=== 0.0.6
 * Added rake tasks to run specs with either the tzinfo gem or activesupport (<=2.2)
 * Default rake task now runs both of these
=== 0.0.5
 * Fixed a bug in occurrence enumeration reported by paulsm on github
=== 0.0.4
 * Fixed a bug in imported timezones reported by paulsm on github
=== 0.0.3
 * Added tzid method to Ruby Time and DateTime instances, and to ActiveRecord::TimeWithZone if it is defined this method is used to determine the desired
timezone when an instance of one of these classes is given as the value of a datetime property.  If the tzid is nil then the default tzid is used,
if it is set to :floating then the property will be a floating time.
 * Removed the ability to pass an array with a tzid string and a date-time since the above made it unnecessary
 * The ruby datetime property returned from the ruby_value method on the DateTime property will return an instance of ::DateTime with:
   ** The proper utc offset
   ** The tzid set to the right tzid
 * Made exdate/rdate building possible
 * Added a default_tzid attribute to the Calendar component, if this attribute is not set for a particular calendar it will delegate to the default set 
for the DateTime property class.
 * Added fix patches from
   ** http://github.com/kjwierenga/ri_cal
   ** http://github.com/wesmaldonado/ri_cal

=== 0.0.2

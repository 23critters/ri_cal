<li>Introduction

</li>
</ol>
<pre>
   The use of calendaring and scheduling has grown considerably in the
   last decade.  Enterprise and inter-enterprise business has become
   dependent on rapid scheduling of events and actions using this
   information technology.  This memo is intended to progress the level
   of interoperability possible between dissimilar calendaring and
   scheduling applications.  This memo defines a MIME content type for
   exchanging electronic calendaring and scheduling information.  The
   Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification, or
   iCalendar, allows for the capture and exchange of information
   normally stored within a calendaring and scheduling application; such
   as a Personal Information Manager (PIM) or a Group Scheduling
   product.

   The iCalendar format is suitable as an exchange format between
   applications or systems.  The format is defined in terms of a MIME
   content type.  This will enable the object to be exchanged using
   several transports, including but not limited to SMTP, HTTP, a file
   system, desktop interactive protocols such as the use of a memory-
   based clipboard or drag/drop interactions, point-to-point
   asynchronous communication, wired-network transport, or some form of
   unwired transport such as infrared might also be used.

   The memo also provides for the definition of iCalendar object methods
   that will map this content type to a set of messages for supporting
   calendaring and scheduling operations such as requesting, replying
   to, modifying, and canceling meetings or appointments, to-dos and
   journal entries.  The iCalendar object methods can be used to define
   other calendaring and scheduling operations such a requesting for and
   replying with free/busy time data.  Such a scheduling protocol is
   defined in the iCalendar Transport-independent Interoperability
   Protocol (iTIP) defined in [I-D.ietf-calsify-2446bis].

   The memo also includes a formal grammar for the content type based on
   the Internet ABNF defined in [RFC5234].  This ABNF is required for
   the implementation of parsers and to serve as the definitive
   reference when ambiguities or questions arise in interpreting the
   descriptive prose definition of the memo.  Additional restrictions
   that could not easily be expressed with the ABNF syntax are specified
   as comments in the ABNF.  Comments with normative statements should
   be treated as such.

<li>Basic Grammar and Conventions

</li>
</ol>
<pre>
   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;NOT RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot; and
   &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   This memo makes use of both a descriptive prose and a more formal
   notation for defining the calendaring and scheduling format.

   The notation used in this memo is the ABNF notation of [RFC5234].
   Readers intending on implementing the format defined in this memo
   should be familiar with this notation in order to properly interpret
   the specifications of this memo.

   All numeric values used in this memo are given in decimal notation.

   All names of properties, property parameters, enumerated property
   values and property parameter values are case-insensitive.  However,
   all other property values are case-sensitive, unless otherwise
   stated.

      Note: All indented editorial notes, such as this one, are intended
      to provide the reader with additional information.  The
      information is not essential to the building of an implementation
      conformant with this memo.  The information is provided to
      highlight a particular feature or characteristic of the memo.

   The format for the iCalendar object is based on the syntax of the
   text/directory media type [RFC2425].  While the iCalendar object is
   not a profile of the text/directory media type [RFC2425], it does
   reuse a number of the elements from the [RFC2425] specification.
</pre>
<p>
2.1. Formatting Conventions
</p>
<pre>
   The elements defined in this memo are defined in prose.  Many of the
   terms used to describe these have common usage that is different than
   the standards usage of this memo.  In order to reference within this
   memo elements of the calendaring and scheduling model, core object
   (this memo) or interoperability protocol [I-D.ietf-calsify-2446bis]
   some formatting conventions have been used.  Calendaring and
   scheduling roles are referred to in quoted-strings of text with the
   first character of each word in upper case.  For example, &quot;Organizer&quot;
   refers to a role of a &quot;Calendar User&quot; within the scheduling protocol
   defined by [I-D.ietf-calsify-2446bis].  Calendar components defined
   by this memo are referred to with capitalized, quoted-strings of
   text.  All calendar components start with the letter &quot;V&quot;.  For
   example, &quot;VEVENT&quot; refers to the event calendar component, &quot;VTODO&quot;
</pre>
<p>
Desruisseaux Expires May 4, 2009 [Page 8]
</p>
<p>
Internet-Draft iCalendar October 2008
</p>
<pre>
   refers to the to-do calendar component and &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; refers to the
   daily journal calendar component.  Scheduling methods defined by iTIP
   [I-D.ietf-calsify-2446bis] are referred to with capitalized, quoted-
   strings of text.  For example, &quot;REQUEST&quot; refers to the method for
   requesting a scheduling calendar component be created or modified,
   &quot;REPLY&quot; refers to the method a recipient of a request uses to update
   their status with the &quot;Organizer&quot; of the calendar component.

   The properties defined by this memo are referred to with capitalized,
   quoted-strings of text, followed by the word &quot;property&quot;.  For
   example, &quot;ATTENDEE&quot; property refers to the iCalendar property used to
   convey the calendar address of a calendar user.  Property parameters
   defined by this memo are referred to with lowercase, quoted-strings
   of text, followed by the word &quot;parameter&quot;.  For example, &quot;value&quot;
   parameter refers to the iCalendar property parameter used to override
   the default value type for a property value.  Enumerated values
   defined by this memo are referred to with capitalized text, either
   alone or followed by the word &quot;value&quot;.  For example, the &quot;MINUTELY&quot;
   value can be used with the &quot;FREQ&quot; component of the &quot;RECUR&quot; value type
   to specify repeating components based on an interval of one minute or
   more.

   In this document, descriptions of characters are of the form
   &quot;character name (codepoint)&quot;, where &quot;codepoint&quot; is from the US-ASCII
   character set.  The &quot;character name&quot; is the authoritative
   description; (codepoint) is a reference to that character in US-
   ASCII.
</pre>
<p>
2.2. Related Memos
</p>
<pre>
   Implementers will need to be familiar with several other memos that,
   along with this memo, form a framework for Internet calendaring and
   scheduling standards.  This memo specifies a core specification of
   objects, value types, properties and property parameters.

   o  iTIP [I-D.ietf-calsify-2446bis] specifies an interoperability
      protocol for scheduling between different implementations;

   o  iMIP [I-D.ietf-calsify-rfc2447bis] specifies an Internet email
      binding for [I-D.ietf-calsify-2446bis].

   This memo does not attempt to repeat the specification of concepts or
   definitions from these other memos.  Where possible, references are
   made to the memo that provides for the specification of these
   concepts or definitions.

<ol>
<li>iCalendar <a href="../Object.html">Object</a> Specification

</li>
</ol>
<pre>
   The following sections define the details of a Calendaring and
   Scheduling Core Object Specification.  The Calendaring and Scheduling
   Core Object is a collection of calendaring and scheduling
   information.  Typically, this information will consist of an
   iCalendar stream with one or more iCalendar objects.  The body of the
   iCalendar object consists of a sequence of calendar properties and
   one or more calendar components.

   Section 3.1 defines the content line format; Section 3.2 defines the
   property parameter format; Section 3.3 defines the data types for
   property values; Section 3.4 defines the iCalendar object format;
   Section 3.5 defines the iCalendar property format; Section 3.6
   defines the calendar component format; Section 3.7 defines calendar
   properties; and Section 3.8 defines calendar component properties.

   This information is intended to be an integral part of the MIME
   content type registration.  In addition, this information can be used
   independent of such content registration.  In particular, this memo
   has direct applicability for use as a calendaring and scheduling
   exchange format in file-, memory- or network-based transport
   mechanisms.
</pre>
<p>
3.1. Content Lines
</p>
<pre>
   The iCalendar object is organized into individual lines of text,
   called content lines.  Content lines are delimited by a line break,
   which is a CRLF sequence (US-ASCII decimal 13, followed by US-ASCII
   decimal 10).

   Lines of text SHOULD NOT be longer than 75 octets, excluding the line
   break.  Long content lines SHOULD be split into a multiple line
   representations using a line &quot;folding&quot; technique.  That is, a long
   line can be split between any two characters by inserting a CRLF
   immediately followed by a single linear white space character (i.e.,
   SPACE, US-ASCII decimal 32 or HTAB, US-ASCII decimal 9).  Any
   sequence of CRLF followed immediately by a single linear white space
   character is ignored (i.e., removed) when processing the content
   type.

   For example the line:

      DESCRIPTION:This is a long description that exists on a long line.

   Can be represented as:
</pre>
<p>
Desruisseaux Expires May 4, 2009 [Page 10]
</p>
<p>
Internet-Draft iCalendar October 2008
</p>
<pre>
      DESCRIPTION:This is a lo
       ng description
        that exists on a long line.

   The process of moving from this folded multiple line representation
   to its single line representation is called &quot;unfolding&quot;.  Unfolding
   is accomplished by removing the CRLF character and the linear white
   space character that immediately follows.

   When parsing a content line, folded lines MUST first be unfolded
   according to the unfolding procedure described above.

      Note: It is possible for very simple implementations to generate
      improperly folded lines in the middle of a UTF-8 multi-octet
      sequence.  For this reason, implementations need to unfold lines
      in such a way to properly restore the original sequence.

   The content information associated with an iCalendar object is
   formatted using a syntax similar to that defined by [RFC2425].  That
   is, the content information consists of CRLF-separated content lines.

   The following notation defines the lines of content in an iCalendar
   object:

      contentline   = name *(&quot;;&quot; param ) &quot;:&quot; value CRLF
      ; This ABNF is just a general definition for an initial parsing
      ; of the content line into its property name, parameter list,
      ; and value string

      ; When parsing a content line, folded lines MUST first
      ; be unfolded according to the unfolding procedure
      ; described above. When generating a content line, lines
      ; longer than 75 octets SHOULD be folded according to
      ; the folding procedure described above.

      name          = iana-token / x-name

      iana-token    = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / &quot;-&quot;)
      ; iCalendar identifier registered with IANA

      x-name        = &quot;X-&quot; [vendorid &quot;-&quot;] 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / &quot;-&quot;)
      ; Reserved for experimental use.

      vendorid      = 3*(ALPHA / DIGIT)
      ; Vendor identification

      param         = param-name &quot;=&quot; param-value *(&quot;,&quot; param-value)
      ; Each property defines the specific ABNF for the parameters

      ; precise parameter ABNF.

      param-name    = iana-token / x-name

      param-value   = paramtext / quoted-string

      paramtext     = *SAFE-CHAR

      value         = *VALUE-CHAR

      quoted-string = DQUOTE *QSAFE-CHAR DQUOTE

      QSAFE-CHAR    = WSP / %x21 / %x23-7E / NON-US-ASCII
      ; Any character except CONTROL and DQUOTE

      SAFE-CHAR     = WSP / %x21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-39 / %x3C-7E
                    / NON-US-ASCII
      ; Any character except CONTROL, DQUOTE, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;:&quot;, &quot;,&quot;

      VALUE-CHAR    = WSP / %x21-7E / NON-US-ASCII
      ; Any textual character

      NON-US-ASCII  = UTF8-2 / UTF8-3 / UTF8-4
      ; UTF8-2, UTF8-3, and UTF8-4 are defined in [RFC3629]

      CONTROL       = %x00-08 / %x0A-1F / %x7F
      ; All the controls except HTAB

   The property value component of a content line has a format that is
   property specific.  Refer to the section describing each property for
   a definition of this format.

   All names of properties, property parameters, enumerated property
   values and property parameter values are case-insensitive.  However,
   all other property values are case-sensitive, unless otherwise
   stated.
</pre>
<p>
3.1.1. List and Field Separators
</p>
<pre>
   Some properties and parameters allow a list of values.  Values in a
   list of values MUST be separated by a COMMA character (US-ASCII
   decimal 44).  There is no significance to the order of values in a
   list.  For those parameter values (such as those that specify URI
   values) that are specified in quoted-strings, the individual quoted-
   strings are separated by a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44).

   Some property values are defined in terms of multiple parts.  These
</pre>
<p>
Desruisseaux Expires May 4, 2009 [Page 12]
</p>
<p>
Internet-Draft iCalendar October 2008
</p>
<pre>
   structured property values MUST have their value parts separated by a
   SEMICOLON character (US-ASCII decimal 59).

   Some properties allow a list of parameters.  Each property parameter
   in a list of property parameters MUST be separated by a SEMICOLON
   character (US-ASCII decimal 59).

   Property parameters with values containing a COLON character (US-
   ASCII decimal 58), a SEMICOLON character (US-ASCII decimal 59) or a
   COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) MUST be placed in quoted text.

   For example, in the following properties a SEMICOLON is used to
   separate property parameters from each other, and a COMMA is used to
   separate property values in a value list.

      ATTENDEE;RSVP=TRUE;ROLE=REQ-PARTICIPANT:mailto:
       jsmith@example.com

      RDATE;VALUE=DATE:19970304,19970504,19970704,19970904
</pre>
<p>
3.1.2. Multiple Values
</p>
<pre>
   Some properties defined in the iCalendar object can have multiple
   values.  The general rule for encoding multi-valued items is to
   simply create a new content line for each value, including the
   property name.  However, it should be noted that some properties
   support encoding multiple values in a single property by separating
   the values with a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44).  Individual
   property definitions should be consulted for determining whether a
   specific property allows multiple values and in which of these two
   forms.  Multi-valued properties MUST NOT be used to specify multiple
   language variants of the same value.  Calendar applications SHOULD
   display all values.
</pre>
<p>
3.1.3. Binary Content
</p>
<pre>
   Binary content information in an iCalendar object SHOULD be
   referenced using a URI within a property value.  That is the binary
   content information SHOULD be placed in an external MIME entity that
   can be referenced by a URI from within the iCalendar object.  In
   applications where this is not feasible, binary content information
   can be included within an iCalendar object, but only after first
   encoding it into text using the &quot;BASE64&quot; encoding method defined in
   [RFC4648].  Inline binary content SHOULD only be used in applications
   whose special circumstances demand that an iCalendar object be
   expressed as a single entity.  A property containing inline binary
   content information MUST specify the &quot;ENCODING&quot; property parameter.
   Binary content information placed external to the iCalendar object

   MUST be referenced by a uniform resource identifier (URI).

   The following example specifies an &quot;ATTACH&quot; property that references
   an attachment external to the iCalendar object with a URI reference:

      ATTACH:http://example.com/public/quarterly-report.doc

   The following example specifies an &quot;ATTACH&quot; property with inline
   binary encoded content information:

      ATTACH;FMTTYPE=image/basic;ENCODING=BASE64;VALUE=BINARY:
       MIICajCCAdOgAwIBAgICBEUwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEEBQAwdzELMAkGA1U

<p>
3.1.4. Character Set
</p>
<pre>
   There is not a property parameter to declare the charset used in a
   property value.  The default charset for an iCalendar stream is UTF-8
   as defined in [RFC3629].

   The &quot;charset&quot; Content-Type parameter MUST be used in MIME transports
   to specify the charset being used.
</pre>
<p>
3.2. Property Parameters
</p>
<pre>
   A property can have attributes associated with it.  These &quot;property
   parameters&quot; contain meta-information about the property or the
   property value.  Property parameters are provided to specify such
   information as the location of an alternate text representation for a
   property value, the language of a text property value, the value type
   of the property value and other attributes.

   Property parameter values that contain the COLON (US-ASCII decimal
   58), SEMICOLON (US-ASCII decimal 59) or COMMA (US-ASCII decimal 44)
   character separators MUST be specified as quoted-string text values.
   Property parameter values MUST NOT contain the DQUOTE (US-ASCII
   decimal 22) character.  The DQUOTE (US-ASCII decimal 22) character is
   used as a delimiter for parameter values that contain restricted
   characters or URI text.  For example:

      DESCRIPTION;ALTREP=&quot;cid:part1.0001@example.org&quot;:The Fall'98 Wild
        Wizards Conference - - Las Vegas\, NV\, USA

   Property parameter values that are not in quoted strings are case
   insensitive.

   Description:  This parameter specifies a URI that points to an
      alternate representation for a textual property value.  A property
      specifying this parameter MUST also include a value that reflects
      the default representation of the text value.  The URI parameter
      value MUST be specified in a quoted-string.

         Note: While there is no restriction imposed on the URI schemes
         allowed for this parameter, CID [RFC2392], HTTP [RFC2616], and
         HTTPS [RFC2818] are the URI schemes most commonly used by
         current implementations.

   Example:

        DESCRIPTION;ALTREP=&quot;CID:part3.msg.970415T083000@example.com&quot;:
         Project XYZ Review Meeting will include the following agenda
          items: (a) Market Overview\, (b) Finances\, (c) Project Man
         agement

   Description:  This property parameter identifies the inline encoding
      used in a property value.  The default encoding is &quot;8BIT&quot;,
      corresponding to a property value consisting of text.  The
      &quot;BASE64&quot; encoding type corresponds to a property value encoded
      using the &quot;BASE64&quot; encoding defined in [RFC2045].

      If the value type parameter is &quot;;VALUE=BINARY&quot;, then the inline
      encoding parameter MUST be specified with the value
      &quot;;ENCODING=BASE64&quot;.

3.2.8. Format Type
</p>
<pre>
   Parameter Name:  FMTTYPE

   Purpose:  To specify the content type of a referenced object.

   Format Definition:  This property parameter is defined by the
      following notation:

        fmttypeparam = &quot;FMTTYPE&quot; &quot;=&quot; type &quot;/&quot; subtype *(&quot;;&quot; parameter)
                        ; Where &quot;type&quot;, &quot;subtype&quot;, and &quot;parameter&quot;
                        ; are defined in section 5.1 of [RFC2045]

   Description:  This parameter can be specified on properties that are
      used to reference an object.  The parameter specifies the content
      type of the referenced object.  For example, on the &quot;ATTACH&quot;
      property, a FTP type URI value does not, by itself, necessarily
      convey the type of content associated with the resource.  The
      parameter value MUST be the text for either an IANA registered
      media type or a non-standard media type.

</p>
<pre>
   Parameter Name:  FBTYPE

   Purpose:  To specify the free or busy time type.

   Format Definition:  This property parameter is defined by the
      following notation:

        fbtypeparam        = &quot;FBTYPE&quot; &quot;=&quot; (&quot;FREE&quot; / &quot;BUSY&quot;
                           / &quot;BUSY-UNAVAILABLE&quot; / &quot;BUSY-TENTATIVE&quot;
                           / x-name
                 ; Some experimental iCalendar free busy type.
                           / iana-token)
                 ; Some other IANA registered iCalendar free busy type.

   Description:  This parameter specifies the free or busy time type.
      The value FREE indicates that the time interval is free for
      scheduling.  The value BUSY indicates that the time interval is
      busy because one or more events have been scheduled for that
      interval.  The value BUSY-UNAVAILABLE indicates that the time
      interval is busy and that the interval can not be scheduled.  The
      value BUSY-TENTATIVE indicates that the time interval is busy
      because one or more events have been tentatively scheduled for
      that interval.  If not specified on a property that allows this
      parameter, the default is BUSY.  Applications MUST treat x-name
      and iana-token value they don't recognized the same way as they
      would the BUSY value.

   Example:  The following is an example of this parameter on a
      &quot;FREEBUSY&quot; property.

   Description:  This parameter identifies the language of the text in
      the property value and of all property parameter values of the
      property.  The value of the &quot;LANGUAGE&quot; property parameter is that
      defined in [RFC4646].

      For transport in a MIME entity, the Content-Language header field
      can be used to set the default language for the entire body part.
      Otherwise, no default language is assumed.

   Example:  The following are examples of this parameter on the
      &quot;SUMMARY&quot; and &quot;LOCATION&quot; properties:

                             *(&quot;,&quot; DQUOTE cal-address DQUOTE)

   Description:  This parameter can be specified on properties with a
      CAL-ADDRESS value type.  The parameter identifies the groups or
      list membership for the calendar user specified by the property.
      The parameter value is either a single calendar address in a
      quoted-string or a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated
      list of calendar addresses, each in a quoted-string.  The
      individual calendar address parameter values MUST each be
      specified in a quoted-string.

   Description:  This parameter can be specified on properties with a
      CAL-ADDRESS value type.  The parameter identifies the
      participation status for the calendar user specified by the
      property value.  The parameter values differ depending on whether
      they are associated with a group scheduled &quot;VEVENT&quot;, &quot;VTODO&quot; or
      &quot;VJOURNAL&quot;.  The values MUST match one of the values allowed for
      the given calendar component.  If not specified on a property that
      allows this parameter, the default value is NEEDS-ACTION.
      Applications MUST treat x-name and iana-token value they don't
      recognized the same way as they would the NEEDS-ACTION value.

3.2.13. Recurrence Identifier Range
</p>
<pre>
   Parameter Name:  RANGE

   Purpose:  To specify the effective range of recurrence instances from
      the instance specified by the recurrence identifier specified by
      the property.

   Format Definition:  This property parameter is defined by the
      following notation:

        rangeparam = &quot;RANGE&quot; &quot;=&quot; &quot;THISANDFUTURE&quot;
        ; To specify the instance specified by the recurrence identifier
        ; and all subsequent recurrence instances

   Description:  This parameter can be specified on a property that
      specifies a recurrence identifier.  The parameter specifies the
      effective range of recurrence instances that is specified by the
      property.  The effective range is from the recurrence identifier
      specified by the property.  If this parameter is not specified on
      an allowed property, then the default range is the single instance
      specified by the recurrence identifier value of the property.  The
      parameter value can only be &quot;THISANDFUTURE&quot; to indicate a range
      defined by the recurrence identifier and all subsequent instances.

3.2.14. Alarm Trigger Relationship
</p>
<pre>
   Parameter Name:  RELATED

   Purpose:  To specify the relationship of the alarm trigger with
      respect to the start or end of the calendar component.

   Format Definition:  This property parameter is defined by the
      following notation:

        trigrelparam       = &quot;RELATED&quot; &quot;=&quot;
                            (&quot;START&quot;       ; Trigger off of start
                           / &quot;END&quot;)        ; Trigger off of end

   Description:  This parameter can be specified on properties that
      specify an alarm trigger with a &quot;DURATION&quot; value type.  The
      parameter specifies whether the alarm will trigger relative to the
      start or end of the calendar component.  The parameter value START
      will set the alarm to trigger off the start of the calendar
      component; the parameter value END will set the alarm to trigger
      off the end of the calendar component.  If the parameter is not
      specified on an allowable property, then the default is START.

                                         ; relationship type

   Description:  This parameter can be specified on a property that
      references another related calendar.  The parameter specifies the
      hierarchical relationship type of the calendar component
      referenced by the property.  The parameter value can be PARENT, to
      indicate that the referenced calendar component is a superior of
      calendar component; CHILD to indicate that the referenced calendar
      component is a subordinate of the calendar component; SIBLING to
      indicate that the referenced calendar component is a peer of the
      calendar component.  If this parameter is not specified on an
      allowable property, the default relationship type is PARENT.
      Applications MUST treat x-name and iana-token value they don't
      recognized the same way as they would the PARENT value.

        sentbyparam        = &quot;SENT-BY&quot; &quot;=&quot; DQUOTE cal-address DQUOTE

   Description:  This parameter can be specified on properties with a

3.2.19. Time Zone Identifier
</p>
<pre>
   Parameter Name:  TZID

   Purpose:  To specify the identifier for the time zone definition for

   Format Definition:  This property parameter is defined by the
      following notation:

        tzidparam  = &quot;TZID&quot; &quot;=&quot; [tzidprefix] paramtext

        tzidprefix = &quot;/&quot;

   Description:  This parameter MUST be specified on the &quot;DTSTART&quot;,
      &quot;DTEND&quot;, &quot;DUE&quot;, &quot;EXDATE&quot; and &quot;RDATE&quot; properties when either a
      DATE-TIME or TIME value type is specified and when the value is
      not either a UTC or a &quot;floating&quot; time.  Refer to the DATE-TIME or
      TIME value type definition for a description of UTC and &quot;floating
      time&quot; formats.  This property parameter specifies a text value

</p>
<pre>
      which uniquely identifies the &quot;VTIMEZONE&quot; calendar component to be
      used when evaluating the time portion of the property.  The value
      of the &quot;TZID&quot; property parameter will be equal to the value of the
      &quot;TZID&quot; property for the matching time zone definition.  An
      individual &quot;VTIMEZONE&quot; calendar component MUST be specified for
      each unique &quot;TZID&quot; parameter value specified in the iCalendar
      object.

      The parameter MUST be specified on properties with a DATE-TIME
      value if the DATE-TIME is not either a UTC or a &quot;floating&quot; time.

      The presence of the SOLIDUS character (US-ASCII decimal 47) as a
      prefix, indicates that this &quot;TZID&quot; represents a unique ID in a
      globally defined time zone registry (when such registry is
      defined).

         Note: This document does not define a naming convention for
         time zone identifiers.  Implementers may want to use the naming
         conventions defined in existing time zone specifications such
         as the public-domain TZ database [TZDB].  The specification of
         globally unique time zone identifiers is not addressed by this
         document and is left for future study.

      The following are examples of this property parameter:

        DTSTART;TZID=America/New_York:19980119T020000

        DTEND;TZID=America/New_York:19980119T030000

      The &quot;TZID&quot; property parameter MUST NOT be applied to DATE
      properties, and DATE-TIME or TIME properties whose time values are
      specified in UTC.

      The use of local time in a DATE-TIME or TIME value without the
      &quot;TZID&quot; property parameter is to be interpreted as a local time
      value, regardless of the existence of &quot;VTIMEZONE&quot; calendar
      components in the iCalendar object.

      For more information see the sections on the value types DATE-TIME
      and TIME.

   Purpose:  To explicitly specify the value type format for a property
      value.

   Format Definition:  This property parameter is defined by the
      following notation:

        valuetypeparam = &quot;VALUE&quot; &quot;=&quot; valuetype

        valuetype  = (&quot;BINARY&quot;
                   / &quot;BOOLEAN&quot;

                   / iana-token)
                   ; Some other IANA registered iCalendar value type.

   Description:  This parameter specifies the value type and format of
      the property value.  The property values MUST be of a single value
      type.  For example, a &quot;RDATE&quot; property cannot have a combination
      of DATE-TIME and TIME value types.

      If the property's value is the default value type, then this
      parameter need not be specified.  However, if the property's
      default value type is overridden by some other allowable value
      type, then this parameter MUST be specified.

      Applications MUST preserve the value data for x-name and iana-
      token values that they don't recognize without attempting to
      interpret or parse the value data.

3.3. Property Value Data Types
</p>
<pre>
   The properties in an iCalendar object are strongly typed.  The
   definition of each property restricts the value to be one of the
   value data types, or simply value types, defined in this section.
   The value type for a property will either be specified implicitly as
   the default value type or will be explicitly specified with the
</pre>
<p>
Desruisseaux Expires May 4, 2009 [Page 30]
</p>
<p>
Internet-Draft iCalendar October 2008
</p>
<pre>
   &quot;VALUE&quot; parameter.  If the value type of a property is one of the
   alternate valid types, then it MUST be explicitly specified with the
   &quot;VALUE&quot; parameter.
</pre>
<p>
3.3.1. Binary
</p>
<pre>
   Value Name:  BINARY

   Purpose:  This value type is used to identify properties that contain
      a character encoding of inline binary data.  For example, an
      inline attachment of a document might be included in an iCalendar
      object.

   Format Definition:  This value type is defined by the following
      notation:

        binary     = *(4b-char) [b-end]
        ; A &quot;BASE64&quot; encoded character string, as defined by [RFC4648].

        b-end      = (2b-char &quot;==&quot;) / (3b-char &quot;=&quot;)

        b-char = ALPHA / DIGIT / &quot;+&quot; / &quot;/&quot;

   Description:  Property values with this value type MUST also include
      the inline encoding parameter sequence of &quot;;ENCODING=BASE64&quot;.
      That is, all inline binary data MUST first be character encoded
      using the &quot;BASE64&quot; encoding method defined in [RFC2045].  No
      additional content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character
      encoding, see Section 3.3.11) is defined for this value type.

   Example:  The following is an abridged example of a &quot;BASE64&quot; encoded
      binary value data.

<p>
3.3.2. Boolean
</p>
<pre>
   Value Name:  BOOLEAN

   Purpose:  This value type is used to identify properties that contain
      either a &quot;TRUE&quot; or &quot;FALSE&quot; Boolean value.

   Format Definition:  This value type is defined by the following
      notation:

        boolean    = &quot;TRUE&quot; / &quot;FALSE&quot;
</pre>
<p>

</p>
<pre>
   Description:  These values are case insensitive text.  No additional
      content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character encoding, see
      Section 3.3.11) is defined for this value type.

   Example:  The following is an example of a hypothetical property that
      has a BOOLEAN value type:

        TRUE
</pre>
<p>
3.3.3. Calendar User Address
</p>
<pre>
   Value Name:  CAL-ADDRESS

   Purpose:  This value type is used to identify properties that contain
      a calendar user address.

   Format Definition:  This value type is defined by the following
      notation:

        cal-address        = uri

   Description:  The value is a URI as defined by [RFC3986] or any other
      IANA registered form for a URI.  When used to address an Internet
      email transport address for a calendar user, the value MUST be a
      mailto URI, as defined by [RFC2368].  No additional content value
      encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character encoding, see Section 3.3.11)
      is defined for this value type.

   Example:

     mailto:jane_doe@example.com
</pre>
<p>
3.3.4. <a href="../Date.html">Date</a>
</p>
<pre>
   Value Name:  DATE

   Purpose:  This value type is used to identify values that contain a
      calendar date.

   Format Definition:  This value type is defined by the following
      notation:

        date               = date-value

                                           ;based on month/year

   Description:  If the property permits, multiple &quot;date&quot; values are
      specified as a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated
      list of values.  The format for the value type is based on the
      [ISO.8601.2004] complete representation, basic format for a
      calendar date.  The textual format specifies a four-digit year,
      two-digit month, and two-digit day of the month.  There are no
      separator characters between the year, month and day component
      text.

      No additional content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character
      encoding, see Section 3.3.11) is defined for this value type.

   Example:  The following represents July 14, 1997:

        19970714
</pre>
<p>
3.3.5. Date-Time
</p>
<pre>
   Value Name:  DATE-TIME

   Purpose:  This value type is used to identify values that specify a
      precise calendar date and time of day.

   Format Definition:  This value type is defined by the following
      notation:

        date-time  = date &quot;T&quot; time ;As specified in the date and time
                                   ;value definitions

   Description:  If the property permits, multiple &quot;date-time&quot; values
      are specified as a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated
      list of values.  No additional content value encoding (i.e.,
      BACKSLASH character encoding, see Section 3.3.11) is defined for
      this value type.

      The &quot;DATE-TIME&quot; value type is used to identify values that contain
      a precise calendar date and time of day.  The format is based on
      the [ISO.8601.2004] complete representation, basic format for a
      calendar date and time of day.  The text format is a concatenation
      of the &quot;date&quot;, followed by the LATIN CAPITAL LETTER T character
      (US-ASCII decimal 84) time designator, followed by the &quot;time&quot;
      format.

      The &quot;DATE-TIME&quot; value type expresses time values in three forms:

      The form of date and time with UTC offset MUST NOT be used.  For
      example, the following is not valid for a date-time value:

        19980119T230000-0800       ;Invalid time format

      FORM #1: DATE WITH LOCAL TIME

      The date with local time form is simply a date-time value that
      does not contain the UTC designator nor does it reference a time
      zone.  For example, the following represents January 18, 1998, at
      11 PM:

        19980118T230000

      Date-time values of this type are said to be &quot;floating&quot; and are
      not bound to any time zone in particular.  They are used to
      represent the same hour, minute, and second value regardless of
      which time zone is currently being observed.  For example, an
      event can be defined that indicates that an individual will be
      busy from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM every day, no matter which time zone
      the person is in.  In these cases, a local time can be specified.
      The recipient of an iCalendar object with a property value
      consisting of a local time, without any relative time zone
      information, SHOULD interpret the value as being fixed to whatever
      time zone the &quot;ATTENDEE&quot; is in at any given moment.  This means
      that two &quot;Attendees&quot;, in different time zones, receiving the same
      event definition as a floating time, may be participating in the
      event at different actual times.  Floating time SHOULD only be
      used where that is the reasonable behavior.

      In most cases, a fixed time is desired.  To properly communicate a
      fixed time in a property value, either UTC time or local time with
      time zone reference MUST be specified.

      The use of local time in a DATE-TIME value without the &quot;TZID&quot;
      property parameter is to be interpreted as floating time,
      regardless of the existence of &quot;VTIMEZONE&quot; calendar components in
      the iCalendar object.

      FORM #2: DATE WITH UTC TIME

      The date with UTC time, or absolute time, is identified by a LATIN
      CAPITAL LETTER Z suffix character (US-ASCII decimal 90), the UTC
      designator, appended to the time value.  For example, the
      following represents January 19, 1998, at 0700 UTC:
</pre>
<p>
Desruisseaux Expires May 4, 2009 [Page 34]
</p>
<p>
Internet-Draft iCalendar October 2008
</p>
<pre>
        19980119T070000Z

      The &quot;TZID&quot; property parameter MUST NOT be applied to DATE-TIME
      properties whose time values are specified in UTC.

      FORM #3: DATE WITH LOCAL TIME AND TIME ZONE REFERENCE

      The date and local time with reference to time zone information is
      identified by the use the &quot;TZID&quot; property parameter to reference
      the appropriate time zone definition.  &quot;TZID&quot; is discussed in
      detail in Section 3.2.19.  For example, the following represents
      2:00 A.M. in New York on Janurary 19, 1998:

        TZID=America/New_York:19980119T020000

      If, based on the definition of the referenced time zone, the local
      time described occurs more than once (when changing from daylight
      to standard time), the DATE-TIME value refers to the first
      occurence of the referenced time.  Thus, TZID=America/
      New_York:20071104T013000 indicates November 4, 2007 at 1:30 A.M.
      EDT (UTC-04:00).  If the local time described does not occur (when
      changing from standard to daylight time), the DATE-TIME value is
      interpreted using the UTC offset before the gap in local times.
      Thus, TZID=America/New_York:20070311T023000 indicates March 11,
      2007 at 3:30 A.M. EDT (UTC-04:00), one hour after 1:30 A.M. EST
      (UTC-05:00).

      A time value MUST only specify the second 60 when specifying a
      positive leap second.  For example:

        19970630T235960Z

      Implementations which do not support leap seconds SHOULD interpret
      the second 60 as equivalent to the second 59.

   Example:  The following represents July 14, 1997, at 1:30 PM in New
      York City in each of the three time formats, using the &quot;DTSTART&quot;
      property.

        DTSTART:19970714T133000                   ; Local time
        DTSTART:19970714T173000Z                  ; UTC time
        DTSTART;TZID=America/New_York:19970714T133000
                                                  ; Local time and time
                                                  ; zone reference

3.3.6. Duration
</p>
<pre>
   Value Name:  DURATION

   Purpose:  This value type is used to identify properties that contain
      a duration of time.

   Format Definition:  This value type is defined by the following
      notation:

        dur-value  = ([&quot;+&quot;] / &quot;-&quot;) &quot;P&quot; (dur-date / dur-time / dur-week)

        dur-date   = dur-day [dur-time]
        dur-time   = &quot;T&quot; (dur-hour / dur-minute / dur-second)
        dur-week   = 1*DIGIT &quot;W&quot;
        dur-hour   = 1*DIGIT &quot;H&quot; [dur-minute]
        dur-minute = 1*DIGIT &quot;M&quot; [dur-second]
        dur-second = 1*DIGIT &quot;S&quot;
        dur-day    = 1*DIGIT &quot;D&quot;

   Description:  If the property permits, multiple &quot;duration&quot; values are
      specified by a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated
      list of values.  The format is based on the [ISO.8601.2004]
      complete representation basic format with designators for the
      duration of time.  The format can represent nominal durations
      (weeks and days) and accurate durations (hours, minutes, and
      seconds).  Note that unlike [ISO.8601.2004] this value type
      doesn't support the &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;M&quot; designators to specify durations
      in terms of years and months.

      The duration of a week or a day depends on its position in the
      calendar.  In the case of discontinuities in the time scale, such
      as the change from standard time to daylight time and back, the
      computation of the exact duration requires the substraction or
      addition of the change of duration of the discontinuity.  Leap
      seconds MUST NOT be considered when computing an exact duration.
      When computing an exact duration, the greatest order time
      components MUST be added first, that is, the number of days MUST
      be added first, followed by the number of hours, number of
      minutes, and number of seconds.

      Negative durations are typically used to schedule an alarm to
      trigger before an associated time (see Section 3.8.6.3).

      No additional content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character
      encoding, see Section 3.3.11) are defined for this value type.

   Format Definition:  This value type is defined by the following
      notation:

        float      = ([&quot;+&quot;] / &quot;-&quot;) 1*DIGIT [&quot;.&quot; 1*DIGIT]

   Description:  If the property permits, multiple &quot;float&quot; values are
      specified by a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated
      list of values.

      No additional content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character
      encoding, see Section 3.3.11) is defined for this value type.

3.3.8. Integer
</p>
<pre>
   Value Name:  INTEGER

   Purpose:  This value type is used to identify properties that contain
      a signed integer value.

   Format Definition:  This value type is defined by the following
      notation:

        integer    = ([&quot;+&quot;] / &quot;-&quot;) 1*DIGIT

   Description:  If the property permits, multiple &quot;integer&quot; values are
      specified by a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated
      list of values.  The valid range for &quot;integer&quot; is -2147483648 to
      2147483647.  If the sign is not specified, then the value is
      assumed to be positive.

      No additional content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character
      encoding, see Section 3.3.11) is defined for this value type.

3.3.9. Period of Time
</p>
<pre>
   Value Name:  PERIOD

   Purpose:  This value type is used to identify values that contain a
      precise period of time.

   Format Definition:  This value type is defined by the following
      notation:

        period     = period-explicit / period-start

        period-explicit = date-time &quot;/&quot; date-time
        ; [ISO.8601.2004] complete representation basic format for a
        ; period of time consisting of a start and end. The start MUST
        ; be before the end.

        period-start = date-time &quot;/&quot; dur-value
        ; [ISO.8601.2004] complete representation basic format for a
        ; period of time consisting of a start and positive duration
        ; of time.

   Description:  If the property permits, multiple &quot;period&quot; values are
      specified by a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated
      list of values.  There are two forms of a period of time.  First,
      a period of time is identified by its start and its end.  This
      format is based on the [ISO.8601.2004] complete representation,
      basic format for &quot;DATE-TIME&quot; start of the period, followed by a
      SOLIDUS character (US-ASCII decimal 47), followed by the &quot;DATE-
      TIME&quot; of the end of the period.  The start of the period MUST be
      before the end of the period.  Second, a period of time can also
      be defined by a start and a positive duration of time.  The format

      is based on the [ISO.8601.2004] complete representation, basic
      format for the &quot;DATE-TIME&quot; start of the period, followed by a
      SOLIDUS character (US-ASCII decimal 47), followed by the
      [ISO.8601.2004] basic format for &quot;DURATION&quot; of the period.

   Example:  The period starting at 18:00:00 UTC, on January 1, 1997 and
      ending at 07:00:00 UTC on January 2, 1997 would be:

        19970101T180000Z/19970102T070000Z

      The period start at 18:00:00 on January 1, 1997 and lasting 5
      hours and 30 minutes would be:

        19970101T180000Z/PT5H30M

   Value Name:  RECUR

   Purpose:  This value type is used to identify properties that contain
      a recurrence rule specification.

   Format Definition:  This value type is defined by the following
      notation:

        recur           = recur-rule-part *( &quot;;&quot; recur-rule-part )

   Description:  This value type is a structured value consisting of a
      list of one or more recurrence grammar parts.  Each rule part is
      defined by a NAME=VALUE pair.  The rule parts are separated from
      each other by the SEMICOLON character (US-ASCII decimal 59).  The
      rule parts are not ordered in any particular sequence.  Individual
      rule parts MUST only be specified once.

         Note: Compliant applications MUST accept rule parts ordered in
         any sequence, but to ensure backward compatibility with
         applications that pre-date this revision of iCalendar the FREQ
         rule part MUST be the first rule part specified in a RECUR
         value.

      The FREQ rule part identifies the type of recurrence rule.  This
      rule part MUST be specified in the recurrence rule.  Valid values
      include SECONDLY, to specify repeating events based on an interval
      of a second or more; MINUTELY, to specify repeating events based
      on an interval of a minute or more; HOURLY, to specify repeating
      events based on an interval of an hour or more; DAILY, to specify
      repeating events based on an interval of a day or more; WEEKLY, to
      specify repeating events based on an interval of a week or more;
      MONTHLY, to specify repeating events based on an interval of a
      month or more; and YEARLY, to specify repeating events based on an
      interval of a year or more.

      The INTERVAL rule part contains a positive integer representing at
      which intervals the recurrence rule repeats.  The default value is
      &quot;1&quot;, meaning every second for a SECONDLY rule, every minute for a
      MINUTELY rule, every hour for an HOURLY rule, every day for a
      DAILY rule, every week for a WEEKLY rule, every month for a
      MONTHLY rule, and every year for a YEARLY rule.  For example,
      within a DAILY rule, a value of &quot;8&quot; means every eight days.

      The UNTIL rule part defines a DATE or DATE-TIME value which bounds
      the recurrence rule in an inclusive manner.  If the value
      specified by UNTIL is synchronized with the specified recurrence,
      this DATE or DATE-TIME becomes the last instance of the
      recurrence.  The value of the UNTIL rule part MUST have the same
      value type as the &quot;DTSTART&quot; property.  Furthermore, if the
      &quot;DTSTART&quot; property is specified as a date with local time, then
      the UNTIL rule part MUST also be specified as a date with local
      time.  If the &quot;DTSTART&quot; property is specified as a date with UTC
      time or a date with local time and time zone reference, then the
      UNTIL rule part MUST be specified as a date with UTC time.  In the
      case of the &quot;STANDARD&quot; and &quot;DAYLIGHT&quot; sub-components the UNTIL
      rule part MUST always be specified as a date with UTC time.  If
      specified as a DATE-TIME value, then it MUST be specified in a UTC
      time format.  If not present, and the COUNT rule part is also not
      present, the &quot;RRULE&quot; is considered to repeat forever.

      The COUNT rule part defines the number of occurrences at which to
      range-bound the recurrence.  The &quot;DTSTART&quot; property value always
      counts as the first occurrence.

      The BYSECOND rule part specifies a COMMA character (US-ASCII
      decimal 44) separated list of seconds within a minute.  Valid
      values are 0 to 60.  The BYMINUTE rule part specifies a COMMA
      character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated list of minutes within
      an hour.  Valid values are 0 to 59.  The BYHOUR rule part
      specifies a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated list
      of hours of the day.  Valid values are 0 to 23.  The BYSECOND,
      BYMINUTE and BYHOUR rule parts MUST NOT be specified when the
      associated &quot;DTSTART&quot; property has a DATE value type.  These rule
      parts MUST be ignored in RECUR value that violate the above
      requirement (e.g., generated by applications that pre-date this
      revision of iCalendar).

      The BYDAY rule part specifies a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal
      44) separated list of days of the week; SU indicates Sunday; MO
      indicates Monday; TU indicates Tuesday; WE indicates Wednesday; TH
      indicates Thursday; FR indicates Friday; SA indicates Saturday.

      Each BYDAY value can also be preceded by a positive (+n) or
      negative (-n) integer.  If present, this indicates the nth
      occurrence of a specific day within the MONTHLY or YEARLY &quot;RRULE&quot;.
      For example, within a MONTHLY rule, +1MO (or simply 1MO)
      represents the first Monday within the month, whereas -1MO
      represents the last Monday of the month.  The numeric value in a
      BYDAY rule part with the FREQ rule part set to YEARLY corresponds
      to an offset within the month when the BYMONTH rule part is
      present, and corresponds to an offset within the year when the
</pre>

      BYWEEKNO or BYMONTH rule parts are present.  If an integer
      modifier is not present, it means all days of this type within the
      specified frequency.  For example, within a MONTHLY rule, MO
      represents all Mondays within the month.  The BYDAY rule part MUST
      NOT be specified with a numeric value when the FREQ rule part is
      not set to MONTHLY or YEARLY.  Furthermore, the BYDAY rule part
      MUST NOT be specified with a numeric value with the FREQ rule part
      set to YEARLY when the BYWEEKNO rule part is specified.

      The BYMONTHDAY rule part specifies a COMMA character (US-ASCII
      decimal 44) separated list of days of the month.  Valid values are
      1 to 31 or -31 to -1.  For example, -10 represents the tenth to
      the last day of the month.  The BYMONTHDAY rule part MUST NOT be
      specified when the FREQ rule part is set to WEEKLY.

      The BYYEARDAY rule part specifies a COMMA character (US-ASCII
      decimal 44) separated list of days of the year.  Valid values are
      1 to 366 or -366 to -1.  For example, -1 represents the last day
      of the year (December 31st) and -306 represents the 306th to the
      last day of the year (March 1st).  The BYYEARDAY rule part MUST
      NOT be specified when the FREQ rule part is set to DAILY, WEEKLY,
      or MONTHLY.

      The BYWEEKNO rule part specifies a COMMA character (US-ASCII
      decimal 44) separated list of ordinals specifying weeks of the
      year.  Valid values are 1 to 53 or -53 to -1.  This corresponds to
      weeks according to week numbering as defined in [ISO.8601.2004].
      A week is defined as a seven day period, starting on the day of
      the week defined to be the week start (see WKST).  Week number one
      of the calendar year is the first week which contains at least
      four (4) days in that calendar year.  This rule part MUST NOT be
      used when the FREQ rule part is set to anything other than YEARLY.
      For example, 3 represents the third week of the year.

         Note: Assuming a Monday week start, week 53 can only occur when
         Thursday is January 1 or if it is a leap year and Wednesday is
         January 1.

      The BYMONTH rule part specifies a COMMA character (US-ASCII
      decimal 44) separated list of months of the year.  Valid values
      are 1 to 12.

      The WKST rule part specifies the day on which the workweek starts.
      Valid values are MO, TU, WE, TH, FR, SA and SU.  This is
      significant when a WEEKLY &quot;RRULE&quot; has an interval greater than 1,
      and a BYDAY rule part is specified.  This is also significant when
      in a YEARLY &quot;RRULE&quot; when a BYWEEKNO rule part is specified.  The
      default value is MO.

      The BYSETPOS rule part specifies a COMMA character (US-ASCII
      decimal 44) separated list of values which corresponds to the nth
      occurrence within the set of recurrence instances specified by the
      rule.  BYSETPOS operates on a set of recurrence instances in one
      interval of the recurrence rule.  For example, in a WEEKLY rule,
      the interval would be one week A set of recurrence instances
      starts at the beginning of the interval defined by the FREQ rule
      part.  Valid values are 1 to 366 or -366 to -1.  It MUST only be
      used in conjunction with another BYxxx rule part.  For example
      &quot;the last work day of the month&quot; could be represented as:

        FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR;BYSETPOS=-1

      Each BYSETPOS value can include a positive (+n) or negative (-n)
      integer.  If present, this indicates the nth occurrence of the
      specific occurrence within the set of occurences specified by the
      rule.

      Recurrence rules may generate recurrence instances with invalid
      date (e.g., February 30) or nonexistent local time (e.g., 1:30 AM
      on a day where the local time is moved forward by an hour at 1:00
      AM).  Such recurrence instances MUST be ignored and MUST NOT be
      counted as part of the recurrence set.

      Information, not contained in the rule, necessary to determine the
      various recurrence instance start time and dates are derived from
      the Start Time (&quot;DTSTART&quot;) component attribute.  For example,
      &quot;FREQ=YEARLY;BYMONTH=1&quot; doesn't specify a specific day within the
      month or a time.  This information would be the same as what is
      specified for &quot;DTSTART&quot;.

      BYxxx rule parts modify the recurrence in some manner.  BYxxx rule
      parts for a period of time which is the same or greater than the
      frequency generally reduce or limit the number of occurrences of
      the recurrence generated.  For example, &quot;FREQ=DAILY;BYMONTH=1&quot;
      reduces the number of recurrence instances from all days (if
      BYMONTH rule part is not present) to all days in January.  BYxxx
      rule parts for a period of time less than the frequency generally
      increase or expand the number of occurrences of the recurrence.
      For example, &quot;FREQ=YEARLY;BYMONTH=1,2&quot; increases the number of
      days within the yearly recurrence set from 1 (if BYMONTH rule part
      is not present) to 2.

      If multiple BYxxx rule parts are specified, then after evaluating
      the specified FREQ and INTERVAL rule parts, the BYxxx rule parts
      are applied to the current set of evaluated occurrences in the
      following order: BYMONTH, BYWEEKNO, BYYEARDAY, BYMONTHDAY, BYDAY,
      BYHOUR, BYMINUTE, BYSECOND and BYSETPOS; then COUNT and UNTIL are

      evaluated.

      The table below summarizes the dependency of BYxxx rule part
      expand or limit behaviour on the FREQ rule part value.

      The term &quot;N/A&quot; means that the corresponding BYxxx rule part MUST
      NOT be used with the corresponding FREQ value.

      BYDAY has some special behaviour depending on the FREQ value and
      this is described in separate notes below the table.

      Here is an example of evaluating multiple BYxxx rule parts.

        DTSTART;TZID=America/New_York:19970105T083000
        RRULE:FREQ=YEARLY;INTERVAL=2;BYMONTH=1;BYDAY=SU;BYHOUR=8,9;
         BYMINUTE=30

      First, the &quot;INTERVAL=2&quot; would be applied to &quot;FREQ=YEARLY&quot; to
      arrive at &quot;every other year&quot;.  Then, &quot;BYMONTH=1&quot; would be applied
      to arrive at &quot;every January, every other year&quot;.  Then, &quot;BYDAY=SU&quot;
      would be applied to arrive at &quot;every Sunday in January, every
      other year&quot;.  Then, &quot;BYHOUR=8,9&quot; would be applied to arrive at
      &quot;every Sunday in January at 8 AM and 9 AM, every other year&quot;.
      Then, &quot;BYMINUTE=30&quot; would be applied to arrive at &quot;every Sunday in
      January at 8:30 AM and 9:30 AM, every other year&quot;.  Then, lacking
      information from &quot;RRULE&quot;, the second is derived from &quot;DTSTART&quot;, to
      end up in &quot;every Sunday in January at 8:30:00 AM and 9:30:00 AM,
      every other year&quot;.  Similarly, if the BYMINUTE, BYHOUR, BYDAY,
      BYMONTHDAY or BYMONTH rule part were missing, the appropriate
      minute, hour, day or month would have been retrieved from the
      &quot;DTSTART&quot; property.

      If the computed local start time of a recurrence instance does not
      exist, or occurs more than once, for the specified time zone, the
      time of the recurrence instance is interpreted in the same manner
      as an explicit DATE-TIME value describing that date and time, as
      specified in Section 3.3.5.

      No additional content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character
      encoding, see Section 3.3.11) is defined for this value type.

   Example:  The following is a rule which specifies 10 occurences which
      occur every other day:

        FREQ=DAILY;COUNT=10;INTERVAL=2

      There are other examples specified in Section 3.8.5.3.

3.3.11. Text
</p>
<pre>
   Value Name:  TEXT

   Purpose:  This value type is used to identify values that contain
      human readable text.

   Format Definition:  This value type is defined by the following
      notation.

        text       = *(TSAFE-CHAR / &quot;:&quot; / DQUOTE / ESCAPED-CHAR)
           ; Folded according to description above

        ESCAPED-CHAR = (&quot;\\&quot; / &quot;\;&quot; / &quot;\,&quot; / &quot;\N&quot; / &quot;\n&quot;)
           ; \\ encodes \, \N or \n encodes newline
           ; \; encodes ;, \, encodes ,

        TSAFE-CHAR = WSP / %x21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-39 / %x3C-5B /
                     %x5D-7E / NON-US-ASCII
           ; Any character except CONTROLs not needed by the current
           ; character set, DQUOTE, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;:&quot;, &quot;\&quot;, &quot;,&quot;

   Description:  If the property permits, multiple TEXT values are
      specified by a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated
      list of values.

      The language in which the text is represented can be controlled by
      the &quot;LANGUAGE&quot; property parameter.

      An intentional formatted text line break MUST only be included in
      a &quot;TEXT&quot; property value by representing the line break with the
      character sequence of BACKSLASH (US-ASCII decimal 92), followed by
      a LATIN SMALL LETTER N (US-ASCII decimal 110) or a LATIN CAPITAL
      LETTER N (US-ASCII decimal 78), that is &quot;\n&quot; or &quot;\N&quot;.

      The &quot;TEXT&quot; property values may also contain special characters
      that are used to signify delimiters, such as a COMMA character for
      lists of values or a SEMICOLON character for structured values.
      In order to support the inclusion of these special characters in
      &quot;TEXT&quot; property values, they MUST be escaped with a BACKSLASH
      character.  A BACKSLASH character (US-ASCII decimal 92) in a
      &quot;TEXT&quot; property value MUST be escaped with another BACKSLASH
      character.  A COMMA character in a &quot;TEXT&quot; property value MUST be
      escaped with a BACKSLASH character (US-ASCII decimal 92).  A
      SEMICOLON character in a &quot;TEXT&quot; property value MUST be escaped
      with a BACKSLASH character (US-ASCII decimal 92).  However, a
      COLON character in a &quot;TEXT&quot; property value SHALL NOT be escaped
      with a BACKSLASH character.

   Example:  A multiple line value of:

        Project XYZ Final Review
        Conference Room - 3B
        Come Prepared.

      would be represented as:

        Project XYZ Final Review\nConference Room - 3B\nCome Prepared.

3.3.12. Time
</p>
<pre>
   Value Name:  TIME

   Purpose:  This value type is used to identify values that contain a
      time of day.

   Format Definition:  This value type is defined by the following
      notation:

        time         = time-hour time-minute time-second [time-utc]

        time-hour    = 2DIGIT        ;00-23
        time-minute  = 2DIGIT        ;00-59
        time-second  = 2DIGIT        ;00-60
        ;The &quot;60&quot; value is used to account for positive &quot;leap&quot; seconds.

        time-utc     = &quot;Z&quot;

   Description:  If the property permits, multiple &quot;time&quot; values are
      specified by a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated
      list of values.  No additional content value encoding (i.e.,
      BACKSLASH character encoding, see Section 3.3.11) is defined for
      this value type.

      The &quot;TIME&quot; value type is used to identify values that contain a
      time of day.  The format is based on the [ISO.8601.2004] complete
      representation, basic format for a time of day.  The text format
      consists of a two-digit 24-hour of the day (i.e., values 00-23),
      two-digit minute in the hour (i.e., values 00-59), and two-digit
      seconds in the minute (i.e., values 00-60).  The seconds value of
      60 MUST only be used to account for positive &quot;leap&quot; seconds.
      Fractions of a second are not supported by this format.

      In parallel to the &quot;DATE-TIME&quot; definition above, the &quot;TIME&quot; value
      type expresses time values in three forms:

      The form of time with UTC offset MUST NOT be used.  For example,
      the following is not valid for a time value:

        230000-0800        ;Invalid time format

      FORM #1 LOCAL TIME

      The local time form is simply a time value that does not contain
      the UTC designator nor does it reference a time zone.  For
      example, 11:00 PM:
</pre>
<p>
Desruisseaux Expires May 4, 2009 [Page 48]
</p>
<p>
Internet-Draft iCalendar October 2008
</p>
<pre>
        230000

      Time values of this type are said to be &quot;floating&quot; and are not
      bound to any time zone in particular.  They are used to represent
      the same hour, minute, and second value regardless of which time
      zone is currently being observed.  For example, an event can be
      defined that indicates that an individual will be busy from 11:00
      AM to 1:00 PM every day, no matter which time zone the person is
      in.  In these cases, a local time can be specified.  The recipient
      of an iCalendar object with a property value consisting of a local
      time, without any relative time zone information, SHOULD interpret
      the value as being fixed to whatever time zone the &quot;ATTENDEE&quot; is
      in at any given moment.  This means that two &quot;Attendees&quot;, may
      participate in the same event at different UTC times; floating
      time SHOULD only be used where that is reasonable behavior.

      In most cases, a fixed time is desired.  To properly communicate a
      fixed time in a property value, either UTC time or local time with
      time zone reference MUST be specified.

      The use of local time in a TIME value without the &quot;TZID&quot; property
      parameter is to be interpreted as a local time value, regardless
      of the existence of &quot;VTIMEZONE&quot; calendar components in the
      iCalendar object.

      FORM #2: UTC TIME

      UTC time, or absolute time, is identified by a LATIN CAPITAL
      LETTER Z suffix character (US-ASCII decimal 90), the UTC
      designator, appended to the time value.  For example, the
      following represents 07:00 AM UTC:

        070000Z

      The &quot;TZID&quot; property parameter MUST NOT be applied to TIME
      properties whose time values are specified in UTC.

      FORM #3: LOCAL TIME AND TIME ZONE REFERENCE

      The local time with reference to time zone information form is
      identified by the use the &quot;TZID&quot; property parameter to reference
      the appropriate time zone definition.  &quot;TZID&quot; is discussed in
      detail in Section 3.2.19.

   Example:  The following represents 8:30 AM in New York in Winter,
      five hours behind UTC, in each of the three formats:

3.3.13. URI
</p>
<pre>
   Value Name:  URI

   Purpose:  This value type is used to identify values that contain a
      uniform resource identifier (URI) type of reference to the
      property value.

   Format Definition:  This value type is defined by the following
      notation:

        uri = &lt;As defined in section 3 of [RFC3986]&gt;

   Description:  This value type might be used to reference binary
      information, for values that are large, or otherwise undesirable
      to include directly in the iCalendar object.

      Property values with this value type MUST follow the generic URI
      syntax defined in [RFC3986].

      When a property parameter value is a URI value type, the URI MUST
      be specified as a quoted-string value.

      No additional content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character
      encoding, see Section 3.3.11) is defined for this value type.

   Example:  The following is a URI for a network file:

        http://example.com/my-report.txt
</pre>

3.3.14. UTC Offset
</p>
<pre>
   Value Name:  UTC-OFFSET

   Purpose:  This value type is used to identify properties that contain

        utc-offset = time-numzone

        time-numzone = (&quot;+&quot; / &quot;-&quot;) time-hour time-minute [time-second]

   Description:  The PLUS SIGN (US-ASCII decimal 43) character MUST be
      specified for positive UTC offsets (i.e., ahead of UTC).  The
      HYPHEN-MINUS character (US-ASCII decimal 45) MUST be specified for
      negative UTC offsets (i.e., behind of UTC).  The value of &quot;-0000&quot;
      and &quot;-000000&quot; are not allowed.  The time-second, if present, MUST
      NOT be 60; if absent, it defaults to zero.

      No additional content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character
      encoding, see Section 3.3.11) is defined for this value type.

   Example:  The following UTC offsets are given for standard time for
      New York (five hours behind UTC) and Geneva (one hour ahead of
      UTC):

        -0500

        +0100

3.4. iCalendar <a href="../Object.html">Object</a>
</p>
<pre>
   The Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object is a collection of
   calendaring and scheduling information.  Typically, this information
   will consist of an iCalendar stream with a single iCalendar object.
   However, multiple iCalendar objects can be sequentially grouped
   together in an iCalendar stream.  The first line and last line of the
   iCalendar object MUST contain a pair of iCalendar object delimiter
   strings.  The syntax for an iCalendar stream is as follows:

        icalstream = 1*icalobject

        icalobject = &quot;BEGIN&quot; &quot;:&quot; &quot;VCALENDAR&quot; CRLF
                     icalbody
                     &quot;END&quot; &quot;:&quot; &quot;VCALENDAR&quot; CRLF

   The following is a simple example of an iCalendar object:

3.5. Property
</p>
<pre>
   A property is the definition of an individual attribute describing a
   calendar object or a calendar component.  A property takes the form
   defined by the &quot;contentline&quot; notation defined in Section 3.1.

   The following is an example of a property:

        DTSTART:19960415T133000Z

   This memo imposes no ordering of properties within an iCalendar
   object.

   Property names, parameter names and enumerated parameter values are
   case insensitive.  For example, the property name &quot;DUE&quot; is the same
   as &quot;due&quot; and &quot;Due&quot;, DTSTART;TZID=America/New_York:19980714T120000 is
   the same as DtStart;TzID=America/New_York:19980714T120000.
</pre>
<p>
3.6. Calendar Components
</p>
<pre>
   The body of the iCalendar object consists of a sequence of calendar
   properties and one or more calendar components.  The calendar
   properties are attributes that apply to the calendar object as a
   whole.  The calendar components are collections of properties that
   express a particular calendar semantic.  For example, the calendar
   component can specify an event, a to-do, a journal entry, time zone
   information, free/busy time information, or an alarm.

   The body of the iCalendar object is defined by the following
   notation:

                     timezonec / iana-comp / x-comp)

                     &quot;END&quot; &quot;:&quot; x-name CRLF

   An iCalendar object MUST include the &quot;PRODID&quot; and &quot;VERSION&quot; calendar
   properties.  In addition, it MUST include at least one calendar
   component.  Special forms of iCalendar objects are possible to
   publish just busy time (i.e., only a &quot;VFREEBUSY&quot; calendar component)
   or time zone (i.e., only a &quot;VTIMEZONE&quot; calendar component)
   information.  In addition, a complex iCalendar object that is used to
   capture a complete snapshot of the contents of a calendar is possible
   (e.g., composite of many different calendar components).  More
   commonly, an iCalendar object will consist of just a single &quot;VEVENT&quot;,
   &quot;VTODO&quot; or &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; calendar component.  Applications MUST ignore
   x-comp and iana-comp they don't recognized.  Applications that
   support importing iCalendar objects SHOULD support all of the
   component types defined in this document, and SHOULD NOT silently
   drop any components as that can lead to user data loss.

                   resources / rdate / x-prop / iana-prop

                   )

   Description:  A &quot;VEVENT&quot; calendar component is a grouping of
      component properties, and possibly including &quot;VALARM&quot; calendar
      components, that represents a scheduled amount of time on a
      calendar.  For example, it can be an activity; such as a one-hour
      long, department meeting from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM, tomorrow.
      Generally, an event will take up time on an individual calendar.
      Hence, the event will appear as an opaque interval in a search for
      busy time.  Alternately, the event can have its Time Transparency
      set to &quot;TRANSPARENT&quot; in order to prevent blocking of the event in
      searches for busy time.

      The &quot;VEVENT&quot; is also the calendar component used to specify an
      anniversary or daily reminder within a calendar.  These events
      have a DATE value type for the &quot;DTSTART&quot; property instead of the
      default value type of DATE-TIME.  If such a &quot;VEVENT&quot; has a &quot;DTEND&quot;
      property, it MUST be specified as a DATE value also.  The
      anniversary type of &quot;VEVENT&quot; can span more than one date (i.e.,
      &quot;DTEND&quot; property value is set to a calendar date after the
      &quot;DTSTART&quot; property value).  If such a &quot;VEVENT&quot; has a &quot;DURATION&quot;
      property, it MUST be specified as a &quot;dur-day&quot; or &quot;dur-week&quot; value.

<pre>
      The &quot;DTSTART&quot; property for a &quot;VEVENT&quot; specifies the inclusive
      start of the event.  For recurring events, it also specifies the
      very first instance in the recurrence set.  The &quot;DTEND&quot; property
      for a &quot;VEVENT&quot; calendar component specifies the non-inclusive end
      of the event.  For cases where a &quot;VEVENT&quot; calendar component
      specifies a &quot;DTSTART&quot; property with a DATE value type but no
      &quot;DTEND&quot; nor &quot;DURATION&quot; property, the event's duration is taken to
      be one day.  For cases where a &quot;VEVENT&quot; calendar component
      specifies a &quot;DTSTART&quot; property with a DATE-TIME value type but no
      &quot;DTEND&quot; property, the event ends on the same calendar date and
      time of day specified by the &quot;DTSTART&quot; property.

      The &quot;VEVENT&quot; calendar component cannot be nested within another
      calendar component.  However, &quot;VEVENT&quot; calendar components can be
      related to each other or to a &quot;VTODO&quot; or to a &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; calendar
      component with the &quot;RELATED-TO&quot; property.

   Example:  The following is an example of the &quot;VEVENT&quot; calendar
      component used to represent a meeting that will also be opaque to
      searches for busy time:

        BEGIN:VEVENT
        UID:19970901T130000Z-123401@example.com
        DTSTAMP:19970901T130000Z
        DTSTART:19970903T163000Z

        SUMMARY:Annual Employee Review
        CLASS:PRIVATE
        CATEGORIES:BUSINESS,HUMAN RESOURCES
        END:VEVENT

      The following is an example of the &quot;VEVENT&quot; calendar component
      used to represent a reminder that will not be opaque, but rather
      transparent, to searches for busy time:

        BEGIN:VEVENT
        UID:19970901T130000Z-123402@example.com
        DTSTAMP:19970901T130000Z
        DTSTART:19970401T163000Z

      used to represent a multi-day event scheduled from June 28th, 2007
      to July 8th, 2007 inclusively.  Note that the &quot;DTEND&quot; property is
      set to July 9th, 2007, since the &quot;DTEND&quot; property specifies the
      non-inclusive end of the event.

   Description:  A &quot;VTODO&quot; calendar component is a grouping of component
      properties and possibly &quot;VALARM&quot; calendar components that
      represent an action-item or assignment.  For example, it can be
      used to represent an item of work assigned to an individual; such
      as &quot;turn in travel expense today&quot;.

      The &quot;VTODO&quot; calendar component cannot be nested within another
      calendar component.  However, &quot;VTODO&quot; calendar components can be
      related to each other or to a &quot;VEVENT&quot; or to a &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; calendar
      component with the &quot;RELATED-TO&quot; property.

      A &quot;VTODO&quot; calendar component without the &quot;DTSTART&quot; and &quot;DUE&quot; (or
      &quot;DURATION&quot;) properties specifies a to-do that will be associated
      with each successive calendar date, until it is completed.

   Examples:  The following is an example of a &quot;VTODO&quot; calendar
      component that needs to be completed before May 1st, 2007.  On
      midnight May 1st, 2007 this to-do would be considered overdue.

        BEGIN:VTODO

      The following is an example of a &quot;VTODO&quot; calendar component that
      was due before 1:00 P.M. UTC on July 9th, 2007 and was completed
      on July 7th, 2007 at 10:00 A.M. UTC.

      component properties that represent one or more descriptive text
      notes associated with a particular calendar date.  The &quot;DTSTART&quot;
      property is used to specify the calendar date that the journal
      entry is associated with.  Generally, it will have a DATE value
      data type, but it can also be used to specify a DATE-TIME value
      data type.  Examples of a journal entry include a daily record of

      a legislative body or a journal entry of individual telephone
      contacts for the day or an ordered list of accomplishments for the
      day.  The &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; calendar component can also be used to
      associate a document with a calendar date.

      The &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; calendar component does not take up time on a
      calendar.  Hence, it does not play a role in free or busy time
      searches -- it is as though it has a time transparency value of
      TRANSPARENT.  It is transparent to any such searches.

      The &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; calendar component cannot be nested within another
      calendar component.  However, &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; calendar components can
      be related to each other or to a &quot;VEVENT&quot; or to a &quot;VTODO&quot; calendar
      component, with the &quot;RELATED-TO&quot; property.

   Example:  The following is an example of the &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; calendar
      component:

        BEGIN:VJOURNAL
        UID:19970901T130000Z-123405@example.com

   Description:  A &quot;VFREEBUSY&quot; calendar component is a grouping of
      component properties that represents either a request for, a reply
      to a request for free or busy time information or a published set
      of busy time information.

      When used to request free/busy time information, the &quot;ATTENDEE&quot;
      property specifies the calendar users whose free/busy time is
      being requested; the &quot;ORGANIZER&quot; property specifies the calendar
      user who is requesting the free/busy time; the &quot;DTSTART&quot; and
      &quot;DTEND&quot; properties specify the window of time for which the free/
      busy time is being requested; the &quot;UID&quot; and &quot;DTSTAMP&quot; properties
      are specified to assist in proper sequencing of multiple free/busy
      time requests.

      When used to reply to a request for free/busy time, the &quot;ATTENDEE&quot;
      property specifies the calendar user responding to the free/busy
      time request; the &quot;ORGANIZER&quot; property specifies the calendar user
      that originally requested the free/busy time; the &quot;FREEBUSY&quot;
      property specifies the free/busy time information (if it exists);
      and the &quot;UID&quot; and &quot;DTSTAMP&quot; properties are specified to assist in
      proper sequencing of multiple free/busy time replies.

</p>
<pre>
      When used to publish busy time, the &quot;ORGANIZER&quot; property specifies
      the calendar user associated with the published busy time; the
      &quot;DTSTART&quot; and &quot;DTEND&quot; properties specify an inclusive time window
      that surrounds the busy time information; the &quot;FREEBUSY&quot; property
      specifies the published busy time information; and the &quot;DTSTAMP&quot;
      property specifies the date/time that iCalendar object was
      created.

      The &quot;VFREEBUSY&quot; calendar component cannot be nested within another
      calendar component.  Multiple &quot;VFREEBUSY&quot; calendar components can
      be specified within an iCalendar object.  This permits the
      grouping of Free/Busy information into logical collections, such
      as monthly groups of busy time information.

      The &quot;VFREEBUSY&quot; calendar component is intended for use in
      iCalendar object methods involving requests for free time,
      requests for busy time, requests for both free and busy, and the
      associated replies.

      Free/Busy information is represented with the &quot;FREEBUSY&quot; property.
      This property provides a terse representation of time periods.
      One or more &quot;FREEBUSY&quot; properties can be specified in the
      &quot;VFREEBUSY&quot; calendar component.

      When present in a &quot;VFREEBUSY&quot; calendar component, the &quot;DTSTART&quot;
      and &quot;DTEND&quot; properties SHOULD be specified prior to any &quot;FREEBUSY&quot;
      properties.

      The recurrence properties (&quot;RRULE&quot;, &quot;RDATE&quot;, &quot;EXDATE&quot;) are not
      permitted within a &quot;VFREEBUSY&quot; calendar component.  Any recurring
      events are resolved into their individual busy time periods using
      the &quot;FREEBUSY&quot; property.

   Example:  The following is an example of a &quot;VFREEBUSY&quot; calendar
      component used to request free or busy time information:

        BEGIN:VFREEBUSY

   Description:  A time zone is unambiguously defined by the set of time
      measurement rules determined by the governing body for a given
      geographic area.  These rules describe at a minimum the base
      offset from UTC for the time zone, often referred to as the
      Standard Time offset.  Many locations adjust their Standard Time
      forward or backward by one hour, in order to accommodate seasonal
      changes in number of daylight hours, often referred to as Daylight
      Saving Time.  Some locations adjust their time by a fraction of an
      hour.  Standard Time is also known as Winter Time.  Daylight
      Saving Time is also known as Advanced Time, Summer Time, or Legal
      Time in certain countries.  The following table shows the changes
      in time zone rules in effect for New York City starting from 1967.
      Each line represents a description or rule for a particular
      observance.

         Note: The specification of a global time zone registry is not
         addressed by this document and is left for future study.
         However, implementers may find the TZ database [TZDB] a useful
         reference.  It is an informal, public-domain collection of time
         zone information, which is currently being maintained by
         volunteer Internet participants, and is used in several
         operating systems.  This database contains current and
         historical time zone information for a wide variety of
         locations around the globe; it provides a time zone identifier
         for every unique time zone rule set in actual use since 1970,
         with historical data going back to the introduction of standard

         time.

      Interoperability between two calendaring and scheduling
      applications, especially for recurring events, to-dos or journal
      entries, is dependent on the ability to capture and convey date
      and time information in an unambiguous format.  The specification
      of current time zone information is integral to this behavior.

      If present, the &quot;VTIMEZONE&quot; calendar component defines the set of
      Standard Time and Daylight Saving Time observances (or rules) for
      a particular time zone for a given interval of time.  The
      &quot;VTIMEZONE&quot; calendar component cannot be nested within other
      calendar components.  Multiple &quot;VTIMEZONE&quot; calendar components can
      exist in an iCalendar object.  In this situation, each &quot;VTIMEZONE&quot;
      MUST represent a unique time zone definition.  This is necessary
      for some classes of events, such as airline flights, that start in
      one time zone and end in another.

      The &quot;VTIMEZONE&quot; calendar component MUST include the &quot;TZID&quot;
      property and at least one definition of a &quot;STANDARD&quot; or &quot;DAYLIGHT&quot;
      sub-component.  The &quot;STANDARD&quot; or &quot;DAYLIGHT&quot; subcomponent MUST
      include the &quot;DTSTART&quot;, &quot;TZOFFSETFROM&quot; and &quot;TZOFFSETTO&quot; properties.

      An individual &quot;VTIMEZONE&quot; calendar component MUST be specified for
      each unique &quot;TZID&quot; parameter value specified in the iCalendar
      object.  In addition, a &quot;VTIMEZONE&quot; calendar component, referred
      to by a recurring calendar component, MUST provide valid time zone
      information for all recurrence instances.

      Each &quot;VTIMEZONE&quot; calendar component consists of a collection of
      one or more sub-components that describe the rule for a particular
      observance (either a Standard Time or a Daylight Saving Time
      observance).  The &quot;STANDARD&quot; sub-component consists of a
      collection of properties that describe Standard Time.  The
      &quot;DAYLIGHT&quot; sub-component consists of a collection of properties
      that describe Daylight Saving Time.  In general this collection of
      properties consists of:

      *  the first onset date-time for the observance;

      *  the last onset date-time for the observance, if a last onset is
         known;

      *  the offset to be applied for the observance;
</pre>
<p>
Desruisseaux Expires May 4, 2009 [Page 67]
</p>
<p>
Internet-Draft iCalendar October 2008
</p>
<pre>
      *  a rule that describes the day and time when the observance
         takes effect;

      *  an optional name for the observance.

      For a given time zone, there may be multiple unique definitions of
      the observances over a period of time.  Each observance is
      described using either a &quot;STANDARD&quot; or &quot;DAYLIGHT&quot; sub-component.
      The collection of these sub-components is used to describe the
      time zone for a given period of time.  The offset to apply at any
      given time is found by locating the observance that has the last
      onset date and time before the time in question, and using the
      offset value from that observance.

      The top-level properties in a &quot;VTIMEZONE&quot; calendar component are:

      The mandatory &quot;TZID&quot; property is a text value that uniquely
      identifies the &quot;VTIMEZONE&quot; calendar component within the scope of
      an iCalendar object.

      The optional &quot;LAST-MODIFIED&quot; property is a UTC value that
      specifies the date and time that this time zone definition was
      last updated.

      The optional &quot;TZURL&quot; property is a url value that points to a
      published &quot;VTIMEZONE&quot; definition.  &quot;TZURL&quot; SHOULD refer to a
      resource that is accessible by anyone who might need to interpret
      the object.  This SHOULD NOT normally be a &quot;file&quot; URL or other URL
      that is not widely-accessible.

      The collection of properties that are used to define the
      &quot;STANDARD&quot; and &quot;DAYLIGHT&quot; sub-components include:

      The mandatory &quot;DTSTART&quot; property gives the effective onset date
      and local time for the time zone sub-component definition.
      &quot;DTSTART&quot; in this usage MUST be specified as a local DATE-TIME
      value.

      The mandatory &quot;TZOFFSETFROM&quot; property gives the UTC offset which
      is in use when the onset of this time zone observance begins.
      &quot;TZOFFSETFROM&quot; is combined with &quot;DTSTART&quot; to define the effective
      onset for the time zone sub-component definition.  For example,
      the following represents the time at which the observance of
      Standard Time took effect in Fall 1967 for New York City:

        DTSTART:19671029T020000

        TZOFFSETFROM:-0400

<p>
Internet-Draft iCalendar October 2008
</p>
<pre>
      The mandatory &quot;TZOFFSETTO&quot; property gives the UTC offset for the
      time zone sub-component (Standard Time or Daylight Saving Time)
      when this observance is in use.

      The optional &quot;TZNAME&quot; property is the customary name for the time
      zone.  This could be used for displaying dates.

      The onset date-times for the observance defined by the time zone
      sub-component is defined by the &quot;DTSTART&quot;, &quot;RRULE&quot;, and &quot;RDATE&quot;
      properties.

      The &quot;RRULE&quot; property defines the recurrence rule for the onset of
      the observance defined by this time zone sub-component.  Some
      specific requirements for the usage of &quot;RRULE&quot; for this purpose
      include:

      *  If observance is known to have an effective end date, the
         &quot;UNTIL&quot; recurrence rule parameter MUST be used to specify the
         last valid onset of this observance (i.e., the UNTIL date-time
         will be equal to the last instance generated by the recurrence
         pattern).  It MUST be specified in UTC time.

      *  The &quot;DTSTART&quot; and the &quot;TZOFFSETFROM&quot; properties MUST be used
         when generating the onset date-time values (instances) from the
         &quot;RRULE&quot;.

      The &quot;RDATE&quot; property can also be used to define the onset of the
      observance by giving the individual onset date and times.  &quot;RDATE&quot;
      in this usage MUST be specified as a local DATE-TIME value,
      relative to the UTC offset specified in the &quot;TZOFFSETFROM&quot;
      property.

      The optional &quot;COMMENT&quot; property is also allowed for descriptive
      explanatory text.

   Example:  The following are examples of the &quot;VTIMEZONE&quot; calendar
      component:

      This is an example showing time zone information for New York City
      using property.  Note that this is only suitable for a recurring
      event that starts on or later than March 11, 2007 at 03:00:00 EDT
      (i.e., the earliest effective transition date and time) and ends
      no later than March 9, 2008 at 01:59:59 EST (i.e., latest valid
      date and time for EST in this scenario).  For example, this can be
      used for a recurring event that occurs every Friday, 8:00 A.M.-
      9:00 A.M., starting June 1, 2007, ending December 31, 2007,

      This is a simple example showing the current time zone rules for
      New York City using a &quot;RRULE&quot; recurrence pattern.  Note that there
      is no effective end date to either of the Standard Time or
      Daylight Time rules.  This information would be valid for a
      recurring event starting today and continuing indefinitely.

   Description:  A &quot;VALARM&quot; calendar component is a grouping of
      component properties that is a reminder or alarm for an event or a
      to-do.  For example, it may be used to define a reminder for a
      pending event or an overdue to-do.

      The &quot;VALARM&quot; calendar component MUST include the &quot;ACTION&quot; and
      &quot;TRIGGER&quot; properties.  The &quot;ACTION&quot; property further constrains
      the &quot;VALARM&quot; calendar component in the following ways:

      When the action is &quot;AUDIO&quot;, the alarm can also include one and
      only one &quot;ATTACH&quot; property, which MUST point to a sound resource,
      which is rendered when the alarm is triggered.

      When the action is &quot;DISPLAY&quot;, the alarm MUST also include a
      &quot;DESCRIPTION&quot; property, which contains the text to be displayed
      when the alarm is triggered.

      When the action is &quot;EMAIL&quot;, the alarm MUST include a &quot;DESCRIPTION&quot;
      property, which contains the text to be used as the message body,
      a &quot;SUMMARY&quot; property, which contains the text to be used as the
      message subject, and one or more &quot;ATTENDEE&quot; properties, which
      contain the email address of attendees to receive the message.  It
      can also include one or more &quot;ATTACH&quot; properties, which are
      intended to be sent as message attachments.  When the alarm is
      triggered, the email message is sent.

      The &quot;VALARM&quot; calendar component MUST only appear within either a
      &quot;VEVENT&quot; or &quot;VTODO&quot; calendar component.  &quot;VALARM&quot; calendar
      components cannot be nested.  Multiple mutually independent
      &quot;VALARM&quot; calendar components can be specified for a single
      &quot;VEVENT&quot; or &quot;VTODO&quot; calendar component.

</p>
<pre>
      The &quot;TRIGGER&quot; property specifies when the alarm will be triggered.
      The &quot;TRIGGER&quot; property specifies a duration prior to the start of
      an event or a to-do.  The &quot;TRIGGER&quot; edge may be explicitly set to
      be relative to the &quot;START&quot; or &quot;END&quot; of the event or to-do with the
      &quot;RELATED&quot; parameter of the &quot;TRIGGER&quot; property.  The &quot;TRIGGER&quot;
      property value type can alternatively be set to an absolute
      calendar date with UTC time.

      In an alarm set to trigger on the &quot;START&quot; of an event or to-do,
      the &quot;DTSTART&quot; property MUST be present in the associated event or
      to-do.  In an alarm in a &quot;VEVENT&quot; calendar component set to
      trigger on the &quot;END&quot; of the event, either the &quot;DTEND&quot; property
      MUST be present, or the &quot;DTSTART&quot; and &quot;DURATION&quot; properties MUST
      both be present.  In an alarm in a &quot;VTODO&quot; calendar component set
      to trigger on the &quot;END&quot; of the to-do, either the &quot;DUE&quot; property
      MUST be present, or the &quot;DTSTART&quot; and &quot;DURATION&quot; properties MUST
      both be present.

      The alarm can be defined such that it triggers repeatedly.  A
      definition of an alarm with a repeating trigger MUST include both
      the &quot;DURATION&quot; and &quot;REPEAT&quot; properties.  The &quot;DURATION&quot; property
      specifies the delay period, after which the alarm will repeat.
      The &quot;REPEAT&quot; property specifies the number of additional
      repetitions that the alarm will be triggered.  This repetition
      count is in addition to the initial triggering of the alarm.  Both
      of these properties MUST be present in order to specify a
      repeating alarm.  If one of these two properties is absent, then
      the alarm will not repeat beyond the initial trigger.

      The &quot;ACTION&quot; property is used within the &quot;VALARM&quot; calendar
      component to specify the type of action invoked when the alarm is
      triggered.  The &quot;VALARM&quot; properties provide enough information for
      a specific action to be invoked.  It is typically the
      responsibility of a &quot;Calendar User Agent&quot; (CUA) to deliver the
      alarm in the specified fashion.  An &quot;ACTION&quot; property value of
      AUDIO specifies an alarm that causes a sound to be played to alert
      the user; DISPLAY specifies an alarm that causes a text message to
      be displayed to the user; and EMAIL specifies an alarm that causes
      an electronic email message to be delivered to one or more email
      addresses.

      In an AUDIO alarm, if the optional &quot;ATTACH&quot; property is included,
      it MUST specify an audio sound resource.  The intention is that
      the sound will be played as the alarm effect.  If an &quot;ATTACH&quot;
      property is specified that does not refer to a sound resource, or
      if the specified sound resource cannot be rendered (because its
      format is unsupported, or because it cannot be retrieved), then
      the CUA or other entity responsible for playing the sound may

<p>
Internet-Draft iCalendar October 2008
</p>
<pre>
      choose a fallback action, such as playing a built-in default
      sound, or playing no sound at all.

      In a DISPLAY alarm, the intended alarm effect is for the text
      value of the &quot;DESCRIPTION&quot; property to be displayed to the user.

      In an EMAIL alarm, the intended alarm effect is for an email
      message to be composed and delivered to all the addresses
      specified by the &quot;ATTENDEE&quot; properties in the &quot;VALARM&quot; calendar
      component.  The &quot;DESCRIPTION&quot; property of the &quot;VALARM&quot; calendar
      component MUST be used as the body text of the message, and the
      &quot;SUMMARY&quot; property MUST be used as the subject text.  Any &quot;ATTACH&quot;
      properties in the &quot;VALARM&quot; calendar component SHOULD be sent as
      attachments to the message.

         Note: Implementations should carefully consider whether they
         accept alarm components from untrusted sources, e.g., when
         importing calendar objects from external sources.  One
         reasonable policy is to always ignore alarm components that the
         calendar user has not set herself, or at least ask for
         confirmation in such a case.

   Example:  The following example is for a &quot;VALARM&quot; calendar component
      that specifies an audio alarm that will sound at a precise time
      and repeat 4 more times at 15 minute intervals:

        BEGIN:VALARM
        TRIGGER;VALUE=DATE-TIME:19970317T133000Z
        REPEAT:4
        DURATION:PT15M
        ACTION:AUDIO
        ATTACH;FMTTYPE=audio/basic:ftp://example.com/pub/
         sounds/bell-01.aud
        END:VALARM

      The following example is for a &quot;VALARM&quot; calendar component that
      specifies a display alarm that will trigger 30 minutes before the
      scheduled start of the event or of the to-do it is associated with
      and will repeat 2 more times at 15 minute intervals:

      The following example is for a &quot;VALARM&quot; calendar component that
      specifies an email alarm that will trigger 2 days before the
      scheduled due date/time of a to-do it is associated with.  It does
      not repeat.  The email has a subject, body and attachment link.

3.7. Calendar Properties

<pre>
   The Calendar Properties are attributes that apply to the iCalendar
   object, as a whole.  These properties do not appear within a calendar
   component.  They SHOULD be specified after the &quot;BEGIN:VCALENDAR&quot;
   delimiter string and prior to any calendar component.

3.7.1. Calendar Scale
</p>
<pre>
   Property Name:  CALSCALE

   Purpose:  This property defines the calendar scale used for the
      calendar information specified in the iCalendar object.

   Value Type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  IANA and non-standard property parameters can
      be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified once in an iCalendar
      object.  The default value is &quot;GREGORIAN&quot;.

   Description:  This memo is based on the Gregorian calendar scale.
      The Gregorian calendar scale is assumed if this property is not
      specified in the iCalendar object.  It is expected that other
      calendar scales will be defined in other specifications or by
      future versions of this memo.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        calscale   = &quot;CALSCALE&quot; calparam &quot;:&quot; calvalue CRLF

        calparam   = *(&quot;;&quot; other-param)

        calvalue   = &quot;GREGORIAN&quot;

   Example:  The following is an example of this property:

        CALSCALE:GREGORIAN
</pre>
<p>
3.7.2. Method
</p>
<pre>
   Property Name:  METHOD

   Purpose:  This property defines the iCalendar object method
      associated with the calendar object.

   Value Type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  IANA and non-standard property parameters can
      be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified once in an iCalendar
      object.

   Description:  When used in a MIME message entity, the value of this
      property MUST be the same as the Content-Type &quot;method&quot; parameter
      value.  If either the &quot;METHOD&quot; property or the Content-Type
      &quot;method&quot; parameter is specified, then the other MUST also be
      specified.

      No methods are defined by this specification.  This is the subject
      of other specifications, such as the iCalendar Transport-
      independent Interoperability Protocol (iTIP) defined by
      [I-D.ietf-calsify-2446bis].

      If this property is not present in the iCalendar object, then a
      scheduling transaction MUST NOT be assumed.  In such cases, the
      iCalendar object is merely being used to transport a snapshot of
      some calendar information; without the intention of conveying a
      scheduling semantic.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        method     = &quot;METHOD&quot; metparam &quot;:&quot; metvalue CRLF

        metparam   = *(&quot;;&quot; other-param)

        metvalue   = iana-token

   Example:  The following is a hypothetical example of this property to
      convey that the iCalendar object is a scheduling request:

        METHOD:REQUEST
</pre>
<p>
3.7.3. Product Identifier
</p>
<pre>
   Property Name:  PRODID

   Purpose:  This property specifies the identifier for the product that
      created the iCalendar object.

   Value Type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  IANA and non-standard property parameters can
      be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  The property MUST be specified once in an iCalendar
      object.

   Description:  The vendor of the implementation SHOULD assure that
      this is a globally unique identifier; using some technique such as
      an FPI value, as defined in [ISO.9070.1991].

      This property SHOULD not be used to alter the interpretation of an
      iCalendar object beyond the semantics specified in this memo.  For
      example, it is not to be used to further the understanding of non-
      standard properties.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        ;Any text that describes the product and version
        ;and that is generally assured of being unique.

   Example:  The following is an example of this property.  It does not
      imply that English is the default language.

</pre>
<p>
3.7.4. Version
</p>
<pre>
   Property Name:  VERSION

   Purpose:  This property specifies the identifier corresponding to the
      highest version number or the minimum and maximum range of the
      iCalendar specification that is required in order to interpret the
      iCalendar object.

   Value Type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  IANA and non-standard property parameters can
      be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property MUST be specified once in an iCalendar
      object.

   Description:  A value of &quot;2.0&quot; corresponds to this memo.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        version    = &quot;VERSION&quot; verparam &quot;:&quot; vervalue CRLF

        verparam   = *(&quot;;&quot; other-param)

   The following properties specify descriptive information about
   calendar components.
</pre>
<p>
3.8.1.1. Attachment
</p>
<pre>
   Property Name:  ATTACH

   Purpose:  This property provides the capability to associate a
      document object with a calendar component.

   Value Type:  The default value type for this property is URI.  The
      value type can also be set to BINARY to indicate inline binary
      encoded content information.

   Property Parameters:  IANA, non-standard, inline encoding, format
      type and value data type property parameters can be specified on
      this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified multiple times in a
      &quot;VEVENT&quot;, &quot;VTODO&quot;, &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; or &quot;VALARM&quot; calendar component with
      the exception of AUDIO alarm which only allows this property to
      occur once.

   Description:  This property is used in &quot;VEVENT&quot;, &quot;VTODO&quot;, and
      &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; calendar components to associate a resource (e.g.,
      document) with the calendar component.  This property is used in
      &quot;VALARM&quot; calendar components to specify an audio sound resource or
      an email message attachment.  This property can be specified as a
      URI pointing to a resource or as inline binary encoded content.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following

   Property Name:  CATEGORIES

   Purpose:  This property defines the categories for a calendar
      component.

   Value Type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  IANA, non-standard, and language property
      parameters can be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  The property can be specified within &quot;VEVENT&quot;, &quot;VTODO&quot;
      or &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; calendar components.

   Description:  This property is used to specify categories or subtypes
      of the calendar component.  The categories are useful in searching
      for a calendar component of a particular type and category.
      Within the &quot;VEVENT&quot;, &quot;VTODO&quot; or &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; calendar components,
      more than one category can be specified as a list of categories
      separated by the COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44).

3.8.1.3. Classification
</p>
<pre>
   Property Name:  CLASS

   Purpose:  This property defines the access classification for a
      calendar component.

   Value Type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  IANA and non-standard property parameters can
      be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  The property can be specified once in a &quot;VEVENT&quot;,
      &quot;VTODO&quot; or &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; calendar components.

   Description:  An access classification is only one component of the
      general security system within a calendar application.  It
      provides a method of capturing the scope of the access the
      calendar owner intends for information within an individual
      calendar entry.  The access classification of an individual
      iCalendar component is useful when measured along with the other
      security components of a calendar system (e.g., calendar user

<pre>
      authentication, authorization, access rights, access role, etc.).
      Hence, the semantics of the individual access classifications
      cannot be completely defined by this memo alone.  Additionally,
      due to the &quot;blind&quot; nature of most exchange processes using this
      memo, these access classifications cannot serve as an enforcement
      statement for a system receiving an iCalendar object.  Rather,
      they provide a method for capturing the intention of the calendar
      owner for the access to the calendar component.  If not specified
      in a component that allows this property, the default value is
      PUBLIC.  Applications MUST treat x-name and iana-token value they
      don't recognized the same way as they would the PRIVATE value.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        class      = &quot;CLASS&quot; classparam &quot;:&quot; classvalue CRLF

        classparam = *(&quot;;&quot; other-param)

        classvalue = &quot;PUBLIC&quot; / &quot;PRIVATE&quot; / &quot;CONFIDENTIAL&quot; / iana-token
                   / x-name

   Property Name:  COMMENT

   Purpose:  This property specifies non-processing information intended
      to provide a comment to the calendar user.

   Value Type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  IANA, non-standard, alternate text
      representation and language property parameters can be specified
      on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified multiple times in
      &quot;VEVENT&quot;, &quot;VTODO&quot;, &quot;VJOURNAL&quot;, and &quot;VFREEBUSY&quot; calendar components
      as well as in the &quot;STANDARD&quot; and &quot;DAYLIGHT&quot; sub-components.

   Purpose:  This property provides a more complete description of the
      calendar component, than that provided by the &quot;SUMMARY&quot; property.

   Value Type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  IANA, non-standard, alternate text
      representation and language property parameters can be specified
      on this property.

   Conformance:  The property can be specified in the &quot;VEVENT&quot;, &quot;VTODO&quot;,
      &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; or &quot;VALARM&quot; calendar components.  The property can be
      specified multiple times only within a &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; calendar

      This property is used in the &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; calendar component to
      capture one or more textual journal entries.

      This property is used in the &quot;VALARM&quot; calendar component to
      capture the display text for a DISPLAY category of alarm, and to
      capture the body text for an EMAIL category of alarm.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        description        = &quot;DESCRIPTION&quot; descparam &quot;:&quot; text CRLF

        descparam  = *(

<pre>
   Conformance:  This property can be specified in &quot;VEVENT&quot; or &quot;VTODO&quot;
      calendar components.

   Description:  This property value specifies latitude and longitude,
      in that order (i.e., &quot;LAT LON&quot; ordering).  The longitude
      represents the location East or West of the prime meridian as a
      positive or negative real number, respectively.  The longitude and
      latitude values MAY be specified up to six decimal places, which
      will allow for accuracy to within one meter of geographical
      position.  Receiving applications MUST accept values of this
      precision and MAY truncate values of greater precision.

      Values for latitude and longitude shall be expressed as decimal
      fractions of degrees.  Whole degrees of latitude shall be
      represented by a two-digit decimal number ranging from 0 through
      90.  Whole degrees of longitude shall be represented by a decimal
      number ranging from 0 through 180.  When a decimal fraction of a
      degree is specified, it shall be separated from the whole number
      of degrees by a decimal point.

      Latitudes North of the equator shall be specified by a plus sign
      (+), or by the absence of a minus sign (-), preceding the digits
      designating degrees.  Latitudes South of the Equator shall be
      designated by a minus sign (-) preceding the digits designating
      degrees.  A point on the Equator shall be assigned to the Northern
      Hemisphere.

      Longitudes east of the prime meridian shall be specified by a plus
      sign (+), or by the absence of a minus sign (-), preceding the
      digits designating degrees.  Longitudes west of the meridian shall
      be designated by minus sign (-) preceding the digits designating
      degrees.  A point on the prime meridian shall be assigned to the
      Eastern Hemisphere.  A point on the 180th meridian shall be
      assigned to the Western Hemisphere.  One exception to this last
      convention is permitted.  For the special condition of describing
      a band of latitude around the earth, the East Bounding Coordinate
      data element shall be assigned the value +180 (180) degrees.

      Any spatial address with a latitude of +90 (90) or -90 degrees
      will specify the position at the North or South Pole,
      respectively.  The component for longitude may have any legal
      value.

      With the exception of the special condition described above, this
      form is specified in Department of Commerce, 1986, Representation
      of geographic point locations for information interchange (Federal
      Information Processing Standard 70-1): Washington, Department of
      Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology.

3.8.1.8. Percent Complete
</p>
<pre>
   Property Name:  PERCENT-COMPLETE

   Purpose:  This property is used by an assignee or delegatee of a
      to-do to convey the percent completion of a to-do to the
      &quot;Organizer&quot;.

   Value Type:  INTEGER

   Property Parameters:  IANA and non-standard property parameters can
      be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified once in a &quot;VTODO&quot;
      calendar component.

   Description:  The property value is a positive integer between zero
      and one hundred.  A value of &quot;0&quot; indicates the to-do has not yet
      been started.  A value of &quot;100&quot; indicates that the to-do has been
      completed.  Integer values in between indicate the percent
      partially complete.

      When a to-do is assigned to multiple individuals, the property
      value indicates the percent complete for that portion of the to-do
      assigned to the assignee or delegatee.  For example, if a to-do is
      assigned to both individuals &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;.  A reply from &quot;A&quot; with a
      percent complete of &quot;70&quot; indicates that &quot;A&quot; has completed 70% of
      the to-do assigned to them.  A reply from &quot;B&quot; with a percent
      complete of &quot;50&quot; indicates &quot;B&quot; has completed 50% of the to-do
      assigned to them.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        percent = &quot;PERCENT-COMPLETE&quot; pctparam &quot;:&quot; integer CRLF

        pctparam   = *(&quot;;&quot; other-param)

   Example:  The following is an example of this property to show 39%
      completion:

   Property Name:  PRIORITY

   Purpose:  This property defines the relative priority for a calendar
      component.

   Value Type:  INTEGER

   Property Parameters:  IANA and non-standard property parameters can
      be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified in &quot;VEVENT&quot; and &quot;VTODO&quot;
      calendar components.

   Description:  This priority is specified as an integer in the range
      zero to nine.  A value of zero (US-ASCII decimal 48) specifies an
      undefined priority.  A value of one (US-ASCII decimal 49) is the
      highest priority.  A value of two (US-ASCII decimal 50) is the
      second highest priority.  Subsequent numbers specify a decreasing
      ordinal priority.  A value of nine (US-ASCII decimal 57 ) is the
      lowest priority.

      A CUA with a three-level priority scheme of &quot;HIGH&quot;, &quot;MEDIUM&quot; and
      &quot;LOW&quot; is mapped into this property such that a property value in
      the range of one (US-ASCII decimal 49) to four (US-ASCII decimal
      52) specifies &quot;HIGH&quot; priority.  A value of five (US-ASCII decimal

      53) is the normal or &quot;MEDIUM&quot; priority.  A value in the range of
      six (US-ASCII decimal 54) to nine (US-ASCII decimal 57 ) is &quot;LOW&quot;
      priority.

      A CUA with a priority schema of &quot;A1&quot;, &quot;A2&quot;, &quot;A3&quot;, &quot;B1&quot;, &quot;B2&quot;, ...,
      &quot;C3&quot; is mapped into this property such that a property value of
      one (US-ASCII decimal 49) specifies &quot;A1&quot;, a property value of two
      (US-ASCII decimal 50) specifies &quot;A2&quot;, a property value of three
      (US-ASCII decimal 51) specifies &quot;A3&quot;, and so forth up to a
      property value of 9 (US-ASCII decimal 57 ) specifies &quot;C3&quot;.

      Other integer values are reserved for future use.

      Within a &quot;VEVENT&quot; calendar component, this property specifies a
      priority for the event.  This property may be useful when more
      than one event is scheduled for a given time period.

      Within a &quot;VTODO&quot; calendar component, this property specified a
      priority for the to-do.  This property is useful in prioritizing
      multiple action items for a given time period.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        priority   = &quot;PRIORITY&quot; prioparam &quot;:&quot; priovalue CRLF
        ;Default is zero (i.e., undefined)

        prioparam  = *(&quot;;&quot; other-param)

        priovalue   = integer       ;Must be in the range [0..9]
           ; All other values are reserved for future use

   Example:  The following is an example of a property with the highest
      priority:

        PRIORITY:1

      The following is an example of a property with a next highest
      priority:

        PRIORITY:2

      The following is an example of a property with no priority.  This
      is equivalent to not specifying the &quot;PRIORITY&quot; property:

        PRIORITY:0

      repeating an alarm.  When the &quot;DURATION&quot; property relates to a
      &quot;DTSTART&quot; property that is specified as a DATE value, then the
      &quot;DURATION&quot; property MUST be specified as a &quot;dur-day&quot; or &quot;dur-week&quot;
      value.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        duration   = &quot;DURATION&quot; durparam &quot;:&quot; dur-value CRLF
                     ;consisting of a positive duration of time.

                     durparam   = *(&quot;;&quot; other-param)

   Example:  The following is an example of this property that specifies
      an interval of time of 1 hour and zero minutes and zero seconds:

        DURATION:PT1H0M0S

      The following is an example of this property that specifies an
      interval of time of 15 minutes.

3.8.2.6. Free/Busy Time
</p>
<pre>
   Property Name:  FREEBUSY

   Purpose:  This property defines one or more free or busy time
      intervals.

   Value Type:  PERIOD

   Property Parameters:  IANA, non-standard, and free/busy time type
      property parameters can be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  The property can be specified in a &quot;VFREEBUSY&quot; calendar
      component.

   Description:  These time periods can be specified as either a start
      and end date-time or a start date-time and duration.  The date and
      time MUST be a UTC time format.

      &quot;FREEBUSY&quot; properties within the &quot;VFREEBUSY&quot; calendar component
      SHOULD be sorted in ascending order, based on start time and then
      end time, with the earliest periods first.

      The &quot;FREEBUSY&quot; property can specify more than one value, separated
      by the COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44).  In such cases, the
      &quot;FREEBUSY&quot; property values MUST all be of the same &quot;FBTYPE&quot;
      property parameter type (e.g., all values of a particular &quot;FBTYPE&quot;
      listed together in a single property).

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        freebusy   = &quot;FREEBUSY&quot; fbparam &quot;:&quot; fbvalue CRLF

        fbparam    = *(
                   ; the following is OPTIONAL,
                   ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

3.8.2.7. Time Transparency
</p>
<pre>
   Property Name:  TRANSP

   Purpose:  This property defines whether an event is transparent or
      not to busy time searches.

   Value Type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  IANA and non-standard property parameters can
      be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified once in a &quot;VEVENT&quot;
      calendar component.

   Description:  Time Transparency is the characteristic of an event
      that determines whether it appears to consume time on a calendar.
      Events that consume actual time for the individual or resource
      associated with the calendar SHOULD be recorded as OPAQUE,
      allowing them to be detected by free-busy time searches.  Other
      events, which do not take up the individual's (or resource's) time
      SHOULD be recorded as TRANSPARENT, making them invisible to free-
      busy time searches.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        transp     = &quot;TRANSP&quot; transparam &quot;:&quot; transvalue CRLF

        transparam = *(&quot;;&quot; other-param)

        transvalue = &quot;OPAQUE&quot;

3.8.3. Time Zone Component Properties
</p>
<pre>
   The following properties specify time zone information in calendar
   components.
</pre>
<p>
3.8.3.1. Time Zone Identifier
</p>
<pre>
   Property Name:  TZID

   Purpose:  This property specifies the text value that uniquely
      identifies the &quot;VTIMEZONE&quot; calendar component in the scope of an
      iCalendar object.

   Value Type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  IANA and non-standard property parameters can
      be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property MUST be specified in a &quot;VTIMEZONE&quot;
      calendar component.

   Description:  This is the label by which a time zone calendar
      component is referenced by any iCalendar properties whose value
      type is either DATE-TIME or TIME and not intended to specify a UTC
      or a &quot;floating&quot; time.  The presence of the SOLIDUS character (US-
      ASCII decimal 47) as a prefix, indicates that this &quot;TZID&quot;
      represents an unique ID in a globally defined time zone registry
      (when such registry is defined).

         Note: This document does not define a naming convention for
         time zone identifiers.  Implementers may want to use the naming
         conventions defined in existing time zone specifications such
         as the public-domain TZ database [TZDB].  The specification of
         globally unique time zone identifiers is not addressed by this
         document and is left for future study.

   Property Parameters:  IANA, non-standard, language, calendar user
      type, group or list membership, participation role, participation
      status, RSVP expectation, delegatee, delegator, sent by, common
      name or directory entry reference property parameters can be
      specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property MUST be specified in an iCalendar object
      that specifies a group scheduled calendar entity.  This property
      MUST NOT be specified in an iCalendar object when publishing the
      calendar information (e.g., NOT in an iCalendar object that
      specifies the publication of a calendar user's busy time, event,
      to-do or journal).  This property is not specified in an iCalendar
      object that specifies only a time zone definition or that defines
      calendar components that are not group scheduled components, but
      are components only on a single user's calendar.

   Description:  This property MUST only be specified within calendar
      components to specify participants, non-participants and the chair
      of a group scheduled calendar entity.  The property is specified
      within an &quot;EMAIL&quot; category of the &quot;VALARM&quot; calendar component to
      specify an email address that is to receive the email type of
      iCalendar alarm.

      The property parameter &quot;CN&quot; is for the common or displayable name
      associated with the calendar address; &quot;ROLE&quot;, for the intended
      role that the attendee will have in the calendar component;
      &quot;PARTSTAT&quot;, for the status of the attendee's participation;
      &quot;RSVP&quot;, for indicating whether the favor of a reply is requested;
      &quot;CUTYPE&quot;, to indicate the type of calendar user; &quot;MEMBER&quot;, to
      indicate the groups that the attendee belongs to; &quot;DELEGATED-TO&quot;,
      to indicate the calendar users that the original request was
      delegated to; and &quot;DELEGATED-FROM&quot;, to indicate whom the request
      was delegated from; &quot;SENT-BY&quot;, to indicate whom is acting on
      behalf of the &quot;ATTENDEE&quot;; and &quot;DIR&quot;, to indicate the URI that
      points to the directory information corresponding to the attendee.
      These property parameters can be specified on an &quot;ATTENDEE&quot;
      property in either a &quot;VEVENT&quot;, &quot;VTODO&quot; or &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; calendar
      component.  They MUST NOT be specified in an &quot;ATTENDEE&quot; property

3.8.4.3. Organizer
</p>
<pre>
   Property Name:  ORGANIZER

   Purpose:  This property defines the organizer for a calendar
      component.

   Value Type:  CAL-ADDRESS

   Property Parameters:  IANA, non-standard, language, common name,
      directory entry reference, sent by property parameters can be
      specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property MUST be specified in an iCalendar object
      that specifies a group scheduled calendar entity.  This property
      MUST be specified in an iCalendar object that specifies the
      publication of a calendar user's busy time.  This property MUST
      NOT be specified in an iCalendar object that specifies only a time
      zone definition or that defines calendar components that are not
      group scheduled components, but are components only on a single
      user's calendar.

   Description:  This property is specified within the &quot;VEVENT&quot;,
      &quot;VTODO&quot;, &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; calendar components to specify the organizer
      of a group scheduled calendar entity.  The property is specified
      within the &quot;VFREEBUSY&quot; calendar component to specify the calendar
      user requesting the free or busy time.  When publishing a
      &quot;VFREEBUSY&quot; calendar component, the property is used to specify
      the calendar that the published busy time came from.

      The property has the property parameters &quot;CN&quot;, for specifying the
      common or display name associated with the &quot;Organizer&quot;, &quot;DIR&quot;, for
      specifying a pointer to the directory information associated with
      the &quot;Organizer&quot;, &quot;SENT-BY&quot;, for specifying another calendar user
      that is acting on behalf of the &quot;Organizer&quot;.  The non-standard
      parameters may also be specified on this property.  If the
      &quot;LANGUAGE&quot; property parameter is specified, the identified
      language applies to the &quot;CN&quot; parameter value.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

3.8.4.4. Recurrence ID
</p>
<pre>
   Property Name:  RECURRENCE-ID

   Purpose:  This property is used in conjunction with the &quot;UID&quot; and
      &quot;SEQUENCE&quot; property to identify a specific instance of a recurring
      &quot;VEVENT&quot;, &quot;VTODO&quot; or &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; calendar component.  The property
      value is the original value of the &quot;DTSTART&quot; property of the
      recurrence instance.

<p>
Desruisseaux Expires May 4, 2009 [Page 114]
</p>
<p>
Internet-Draft iCalendar October 2008
</p>
<pre>
   Value Type:  The default value type for this property is DATE-TIME.
      The time format can be any of the valid forms defined for a DATE-
      TIME value type.  See DATE-TIME value type definition for specific
      interpretations of the various forms.  The value type can be set
      to DATE.

   Property Parameters:  IANA, non-standard, value data type, time zone
      identifier and recurrence identifier range parameters can be
      specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified in an iCalendar object
      containing a recurring calendar component.

   Description:  The full range of calendar components specified by a
      recurrence set is referenced by referring to just the &quot;UID&quot;
      property value corresponding to the calendar component.  The
      &quot;RECURRENCE-ID&quot; property allows the reference to an individual
      instance within the recurrence set.

      If the value of the &quot;DTSTART&quot; property is a DATE type value, then
      the value MUST be the calendar date for the recurrence instance.

      The date/time value is set to the time when the original
      recurrence instance would occur; meaning that if the intent is to
      change a Friday meeting to Thursday, the date/time is still set to
      the original Friday meeting.

      The &quot;RECURRENCE-ID&quot; property is used in conjunction with the &quot;UID&quot;
      and &quot;SEQUENCE&quot; property to identify a particular instance of a
      recurring event, to-do or journal.  For a given pair of &quot;UID&quot; and
      &quot;SEQUENCE&quot; property values, the &quot;RECURRENCE-ID&quot; value for a
      recurrence instance is fixed.

      The &quot;RANGE&quot; parameter is used to specify the effective range of
      recurrence instances from the instance specified by the
      &quot;RECURRENCE-ID&quot; property value.  The value for the range parameter
      can only be &quot;THISANDFUTURE&quot; to indicate a range defined by the
      given recurrence instance and all subsequent instances.
      Subsequent instances are determined by their &quot;RECURRENCE-ID&quot; value
      and not their current scheduled start time.  Subsequent instances
      defined in separate components are not impacted by the given
      recurrence instance.  When the given recurrence instance is
      rescheduled, all subsequent instances are also rescheduled by the
      same time difference.  For instance, if the given recurrence
      instance is rescheduled to start 2 hours later, then all
      subsequent instances are also rescheduled 2 hours later.
      Similarly, if the duration of the given recurrence instance is
      modified, then all subsequence instances are also modified to have

      this same duration.

         Note: The &quot;RANGE&quot; parameter may not be appropriate to
         reschedule specific subsequent instances of complex recurring
         calendar component.  Assuming an unbounded recurring calendar
         component scheduled to occur on Mondays and Wednesdays, the
         &quot;RANGE&quot; parameter could not be used to reschedule only the
         future Monday instances to occur on Tuesday instead.  In such
         cases, the calendar application could simply truncate the
         unbounded recurring calendar component (i.e., with the &quot;COUNT&quot;
         or &quot;UNTIL&quot; rule parts), and create two new unbounded recurring
         calendar components for the future instances.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

          recurid    = &quot;RECURRENCE-ID&quot; ridparam &quot;:&quot; ridval CRLF

        ridparam   = *(

                   ; the following are OPTIONAL,
                   ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                   (&quot;;&quot; &quot;VALUE&quot; &quot;=&quot; (&quot;DATE-TIME&quot; / &quot;DATE&quot;)) /
                   (&quot;;&quot; tzidparam) / (&quot;;&quot; rangeparam) /

                   ; the following is OPTIONAL,
                   ; and MAY occur more than once

                   (&quot;;&quot; other-param)

                   )

        ridval     = date-time / date
        ;Value MUST match value type

   Example:  The following are examples of this property:

   Property Name:  RELATED-TO

   Purpose:  This property is used to represent a relationship or
      reference between one calendar component and another.

   Value Type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  IANA, non-standard, and relationship type
      property parameters can be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified in the &quot;VEVENT&quot;, &quot;VTODO&quot;
      and &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; calendar components.

   Description:  The property value consists of the persistent, globally
      unique identifier of another calendar component.  This value would
      be represented in a calendar component by the &quot;UID&quot; property.

      By default, the property value points to another calendar
      component that has a PARENT relationship to the referencing
      object.  The &quot;RELTYPE&quot; property parameter is used to either
      explicitly state the default PARENT relationship type to the
      referenced calendar component or to override the default PARENT
      relationship type and specify either a CHILD or SIBLING
      relationship.  The PARENT relationship indicates that the calendar
      component is a subordinate of the referenced calendar component.
      The CHILD relationship indicates that the calendar component is a
      superior of the referenced calendar component.  The SIBLING
      relationship indicates that the calendar component is a peer of
      the referenced calendar component.

      Changes to a calendar component referenced by this property can
      have an implicit impact on the related calendar component.  For
      example, if a group event changes its start or end date or time,
      then the related, dependent events will need to have their start
      and end dates changed in a corresponding way.  Similarly, if a
      PARENT calendar component is cancelled or deleted, then there is
      an implied impact to the related CHILD calendar components.  This
      property is intended only to provide information on the
      relationship of calendar components.  It is up to the target
      calendar system to maintain any property implications of this
      relationship.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following

3.8.4.6. Uniform Resource Locator
</p>
<pre>
   Property Name:  URL

   Purpose:  This property defines a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
      associated with the iCalendar object.

   Value Type:  URI

   Property Parameters:  IANA and non-standard property parameters can
      be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified once in the &quot;VEVENT&quot;,
      &quot;VTODO&quot;, &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; or &quot;VFREEBUSY&quot; calendar components.

   Description:  This property may be used in a calendar component to
      convey a location where a more dynamic rendition of the calendar
      information associated with the calendar component can be found.
      This memo does not attempt to standardize the form of the URI, nor
      the format of the resource pointed to by the property value.  If
      the URL property and Content-Location MIME header are both
      specified, they MUST point to the same resource.

3.8.4.7. Unique Identifier
</p>
<pre>
   Property Name:  UID

   Purpose:  This property defines the persistent, globally unique
      identifier for the calendar component.

   Value Type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  IANA and non-standard property parameters can
      be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  The property MUST be specified in the &quot;VEVENT&quot;,
      &quot;VTODO&quot;, &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; or &quot;VFREEBUSY&quot; calendar components.

   Description:  The &quot;UID&quot; itself MUST be a globally unique identifier.
      The generator of the identifier MUST guarantee that the identifier
      is unique.  There are several algorithms that can be used to
      accomplish this.  A good method to assure uniqueness is to put the
      domain name or a domain literal IP address of the host on which
      the identifier was created on the right hand side of an &quot;@&quot;, and
      on the left hand side, put a combination of the current calendar
      date and time of day (i.e., formatted in as a DATE-TIME value)
      along with some other currently unique (perhaps sequential)
      identifier available on the system (for example, a process id
      number).  Using a date/time value on the left hand side and a
      domain name or domain literal on the right hand side makes it
      possible to guarantee uniqueness since no two hosts should be
      using the same domain name or IP address at the same time.  Though
      other algorithms will work, it is RECOMMENDED that the right hand
      side contain some domain identifier (either of the host itself or
      otherwise) such that the generator of the message identifier can
      guarantee the uniqueness of the left hand side within the scope of
      that domain.

      This is the method for correlating scheduling messages with the
      referenced &quot;VEVENT&quot;, &quot;VTODO&quot;, or &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; calendar component.

      The full range of calendar components specified by a recurrence
      set is referenced by referring to just the &quot;UID&quot; property value
      corresponding to the calendar component.  The &quot;RECURRENCE-ID&quot;
      property allows the reference to an individual instance within the
      recurrence set.

      This property is an important method for group scheduling
      applications to match requests with later replies, modifications
      or deletion requests.  Calendaring and scheduling applications
      MUST generate this property in &quot;VEVENT&quot;, &quot;VTODO&quot; and &quot;VJOURNAL&quot;
      calendar components to assure interoperability with other group
      scheduling applications.  This identifier is created by the
      calendar system that generates an iCalendar object.

      Implementations MUST be able to receive and persist values of at
      least 255 octets for this property but MUST NOT truncate values in
      the middle of a UTF-8 multi-octet sequence.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        uid        = &quot;UID&quot; uidparam &quot;:&quot; text CRLF

        uidparam   = *(&quot;;&quot; other-param)

   Value Type:  The default value type for this property is DATE-TIME.
      The value type can be set to DATE.

   Property Parameters:  IANA, non-standard, value data type and time
      zone identifier property parameters can be specified on this
      property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified in recurring &quot;VEVENT&quot;,
      &quot;VTODO&quot;, and &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; calendar components as well as in the
      &quot;STANDARD&quot; and &quot;DAYLIGHT&quot; sub-components of the &quot;VTIMEZONE&quot;
      calendar component.

   Description:  The exception dates, if specified, are used in
      computing the recurrence set.  The recurrence set is the complete
      set of recurrence instances for a calendar component.  The
      recurrence set is generated by considering the initial &quot;DTSTART&quot;
      property along with the &quot;RRULE&quot;, &quot;RDATE&quot;, and &quot;EXDATE&quot; properties
      contained within the recurring component.  The &quot;DTSTART&quot; property
      defines the first instance in the recurrence set.  The &quot;DTSTART&quot;
      property value SHOULD match the pattern of the recurrence rule, if
      specified.  The recurrence set generated with a &quot;DTSTART&quot; property
      value that doesn't match the pattern of the rule is undefined.
      The final recurrence set is generated by gathering all of the
      start date-times generated by any of the specified &quot;RRULE&quot; and
      &quot;RDATE&quot; properties, and then excluding any start date and times
      specified by &quot;EXDATE&quot; properties.  This implies that start date
      and times specified by &quot;EXDATE&quot; properties take precedence over
      those specified by inclusion properties (i.e., &quot;RDATE&quot; and
      &quot;RRULE&quot;).  When duplicate instances are generated by the &quot;RRULE&quot;
      and &quot;RDATE&quot; properties, only one recurrence is considered.
      Duplicate instances are ignored.

      The &quot;EXDATE&quot; property can be used to exclude the value specified
      in &quot;DTSTART&quot;.  However, in such cases the original &quot;DTSTART&quot; date
      MUST still be maintained by the calendaring and scheduling system
      because the original &quot;DTSTART&quot; value has inherent usage
      dependencies by other properties such as the &quot;RECURRENCE-ID&quot;.

      &quot;STANDARD&quot; and &quot;DAYLIGHT&quot; sub-components of the &quot;VTIMEZONE&quot;
      calendar component.

   Description:  This property can appear along with the &quot;RRULE&quot;

      recurrence instances for a calendar component.  The recurrence set
      is generated by considering the initial &quot;DTSTART&quot; property along
      with the &quot;RRULE&quot;, &quot;RDATE&quot;, and &quot;EXDATE&quot; properties contained
      within the recurring component.  The &quot;DTSTART&quot; property defines
      the first instance in the recurrence set.  The &quot;DTSTART&quot; property
      value SHOULD match the pattern of the recurrence rule, if
      specified.  The recurrence set generated with a &quot;DTSTART&quot; property
      value that doesn't match the pattern of the rule is undefined.
      The final recurrence set is generated by gathering all of the
      start date-times generated by any of the specified &quot;RRULE&quot; and
      &quot;RDATE&quot; properties, and then excluding any start date and times
      specified by &quot;EXDATE&quot; properties.  This implies that start date/
      times specified by &quot;EXDATE&quot; properties take precedence over those
      specified by inclusion properties (i.e., &quot;RDATE&quot; and &quot;RRULE&quot;).
      Where duplicate instances are generated by the &quot;RRULE&quot; and &quot;RDATE&quot;
      properties, only one recurrence is considered.  Duplicate
      instances are ignored.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        rdate      = &quot;RDATE&quot; rdtparam &quot;:&quot; rdtval *(&quot;,&quot; rdtval) CRLF

3.8.5.3. Recurrence Rule
</p>
<pre>
   Property Name:  RRULE

   Purpose:  This property defines a rule or repeating pattern for
      recurring events, to-dos, journal entries or time zone
      definitions.

   Value Type:  RECUR

   Property Parameters:  IANA and non-standard property parameters can
      be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified in recurring &quot;VEVENT&quot;,
      &quot;VTODO&quot; and &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; calendar components as well as in the
      &quot;STANDARD&quot; and &quot;DAYLIGHT&quot; sub-components of the &quot;VTIMEZONE&quot;
      calendar component, but it SHOULD NOT be specified more than once.
      The recurrence set generated with multiple &quot;RRULE&quot; properties is
      undefined.

   Description:  The recurrence rule, if specified, is used in computing
      the recurrence set.  The recurrence set is the complete set of
      recurrence instances for a calendar component.  The recurrence set
      is generated by considering the initial &quot;DTSTART&quot; property along
      with the &quot;RRULE&quot;, &quot;RDATE&quot;, and &quot;EXDATE&quot; properties contained
      within the recurring component.  The &quot;DTSTART&quot; property defines
      the first instance in the recurrence set.  The &quot;DTSTART&quot; property
      value SHOULD be synchronized with the recurrence rule, if
      specified.  The recurrence set generated with a &quot;DTSTART&quot; property
      value not synchronized with the recurrence rule is undefined.  The
      final recurrence set is generated by gathering all of the start
      date/times generated by any of the specified &quot;RRULE&quot; and &quot;RDATE&quot;
      properties, and then excluding any start date/times specified by
      &quot;EXDATE&quot; properties.  This implies that start date/times specified
      by &quot;EXDATE&quot; properties take precedence over those specified by
      inclusion properties (i.e., &quot;RDATE&quot; and &quot;RRULE&quot;).  Where duplicate
      instances are generated by the &quot;RRULE&quot; and &quot;RDATE&quot; properties,
</pre>

</p>
<pre>
      only one recurrence is considered.  Duplicate instances are
      ignored.

      The &quot;DTSTART&quot; property specified within the iCalendar object
      defines the first instance of the recurrence.  In most cases, a
      &quot;DTSTART&quot; property of DATE-TIME value type used with a recurrence
      rule, should be specified as a date with local time and time zone
      reference to make sure all the recurrence instances start at the
      same local time regardless of time zone changes.

      If the duration of the recurring component is specified with the
      &quot;DTEND&quot; or &quot;DUE&quot; property, then the same exact duration will apply
      to all the members of the generated recurrence set.  Else, if the
      duration of the recurring component is specified with the
      &quot;DURATION&quot; property, then the same nominal duration will apply to
      all the members of the generated recurrence set and the exact
      duration of each recurrence instance will depend on its specific
      start time.  For example, recurrence instances of a nominal
      duration of one day will have an exact duration of more or less
      than 24 hours on a day where a time zone shift occurs.  The
      duration of a specific recurrence may be modified in an exception
      component or simply by using an &quot;RDATE&quot; property of PERIOD value
      type.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        rrule      = &quot;RRULE&quot; rrulparam &quot;:&quot; recur CRLF

        rrulparam  = *(&quot;;&quot; other-param)

   Example:  All examples assume the Eastern United States time zone.

3.8.6. Alarm Component Properties
</p>
<pre>
   The following properties specify alarm information in calendar
   components.
</pre>
<p>
3.8.6.1. Action
</p>
<pre>
   Property Name:  ACTION

   Purpose:  This property defines the action to be invoked when an
      alarm is triggered.

   Value Type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  IANA and non-standard property parameters can
      be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property MUST be specified once in a &quot;VALARM&quot;
      calendar component.

   Description:  Each &quot;VALARM&quot; calendar component has a particular type
      of action associated with it.  This property specifies the type of
      action.  Applications MUST ignore alarms with x-name and iana-
      token value they don't recognize.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        action      = &quot;ACTION&quot; actionparam &quot;:&quot; actionvalue CRLF

        actionparam = *(&quot;;&quot; other-param)

        actionvalue = &quot;AUDIO&quot; / &quot;DISPLAY&quot; / &quot;EMAIL&quot;
                    / iana-token / x-name

   Example:  The following are examples of this property in a &quot;VALARM&quot;
      calendar component:

        ACTION:AUDIO

        ACTION:DISPLAY
</pre>
<p>
3.8.6.2. Repeat Count
</p>
<pre>
   Property Name:  REPEAT

   Purpose:  This property defines the number of times the alarm should
      be repeated, after the initial trigger.

   Value Type:  INTEGER

   Property Parameters:  IANA and non-standard property parameters can
      be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified in a &quot;VALARM&quot; calendar
      component.

   Description:  This property defines the number of time an alarm
      should be repeated after its initial trigger.  If the alarm
      triggers more than once, then this property MUST be specified
      along with the &quot;DURATION&quot; property.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        repeat  = &quot;REPEAT&quot; repparam &quot;:&quot; integer CRLF
        ;Default is &quot;0&quot;, zero.

        repparam   = *(&quot;;&quot; other-param)

   Example:  The following is an example of this property for an alarm
      that repeats 4 additional times with a 5 minute delay after the
      initial triggering of the alarm:

        REPEAT:4
        DURATION:PT5M

<p>
Internet-Draft iCalendar October 2008
</p>
<pre>
   Property Name:  TRIGGER

   Purpose:  This property specifies when an alarm will trigger.

   Value Type:  The default value type is DURATION.  The value type can
      be set to a DATE-TIME value type, in which case the value MUST
      specify a UTC formatted DATE-TIME value.

   Property Parameters:  IANA, non-standard, value data type, time zone
      identifier or trigger relationship property parameters can be
      specified on this property.  The trigger relationship property
      parameter MUST only be specified when the value type is
      &quot;DURATION&quot;.

   Conformance:  This property MUST be specified in the &quot;VALARM&quot;
      calendar component.

   Description:  This property defines when an alarm will trigger.  The
      default value type is DURATION, specifying a relative time for the
      trigger of the alarm.  The default duration is relative to the
      start of an event or to-do that the alarm is associated with.  The
      duration can be explicitly set to trigger from either the end or
      the start of the associated event or to-do with the &quot;RELATED&quot;
      parameter.  A value of START will set the alarm to trigger off the
      start of the associated event or to-do.  A value of END will set
      the alarm to trigger off the end of the associated event or to-do.

      Either a positive or negative duration may be specified for the
      &quot;TRIGGER&quot; property.  An alarm with a positive duration is
      triggered after the associated start or end of the event or to-do.
      An alarm with a negative duration is triggered before the
      associated start or end of the event or to-do.

      The &quot;RELATED&quot; property parameter is not valid if the value type of
      the property is set to DATE-TIME (i.e., for an absolute date and
      time alarm trigger).  If a value type of DATE-TIME is specified,
      then the property value MUST be specified in the UTC time format.
      If an absolute trigger is specified on an alarm for a recurring
      event or to-do, then the alarm will only trigger for the specified
      absolute date/time, along with any specified repeating instances.

      If the trigger is set relative to START, then the &quot;DTSTART&quot;
      property MUST be present in the associated &quot;VEVENT&quot; or &quot;VTODO&quot;
      calendar component.  If an alarm is specified for an event with
      the trigger set relative to the END, then the &quot;DTEND&quot; property or
      the &quot;DTSTART&quot; and &quot;DURATION &quot; properties MUST be present in the
      associated &quot;VEVENT&quot; calendar component.  If the alarm is specified
      for a to-do with a trigger set relative to the END, then either

<pre>
      the &quot;DUE&quot; property or the &quot;DTSTART&quot; and &quot;DURATION &quot; properties
      MUST be present in the associated &quot;VTODO&quot; calendar component.

      Alarms specified in an event or to-do which is defined in terms of
      a DATE value type will be triggered relative to 00:00:00 of the
      user's configured time zone on the specified date, or relative to
      00:00:00 UTC on the specified date if no configured time zone can
      be found for the user.  For example, if &quot;DTSTART&quot; is a DATE value
      set to 19980205 then the duration trigger will be relative to
      19980205T000000 America/New_York for a user configured with the
      America/New_York time zone.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        trigger    = &quot;TRIGGER&quot; (trigrel / trigabs) CRLF

        trigrel    = *(

                   ; the following are OPTIONAL,
                   ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                   ; the following is REQUIRED,
                   ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                     (&quot;;&quot; &quot;VALUE&quot; &quot;=&quot; &quot;DATE-TIME&quot;) /

                   ; the following is OPTIONAL,
                   ; and MAY occur more than once

3.8.7. Change Management Component Properties
</p>
<pre>
   The following properties specify change management information in
   calendar components.
</pre>
<p>
3.8.7.1. Date/Time Created
</p>
<pre>
   Property Name:  CREATED

   Purpose:  This property specifies the date and time that the calendar
      information was created by the calendar user agent in the calendar
      store.

         Note: This is analogous to the creation date and time for a
         file in the file system.

   Value Type:  DATE-TIME

   Property Parameters:  IANA and non-standard property parameters can
      be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  The property can be specified once in &quot;VEVENT&quot;, &quot;VTODO&quot;
      or &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; calendar components.  The value MUST be specified as
      a date with UTC time.

   Description:  This property specifies the date and time that the
      calendar information was created by the calendar user agent in the
      calendar store.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        created    = &quot;CREATED&quot; creaparam &quot;:&quot; date-time CRLF

        creaparam  = *(&quot;;&quot; other-param)

   Example:  The following is an example of this property:

        CREATED:19960329T133000Z
</pre>
<p>
3.8.7.2. Date/Time Stamp
</p>
<pre>
   Property Name:  DTSTAMP

   Purpose:  In the case of an iCalendar object that specifies a
      &quot;METHOD&quot; property, this property specifies the date and time that
      the instance of the iCalendar object was created.  In the case of
      an iCalendar object that doesn't specify a &quot;METHOD&quot; property, this
      property specifies the date and time that the information
      associated with the calendar component was last revised in the
      calendar store.

   Value Type:  DATE-TIME

   Property Parameters:  IANA and non-standard property parameters can
      be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property MUST be included in the &quot;VEVENT&quot;,
      &quot;VTODO&quot;, &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; or &quot;VFREEBUSY&quot; calendar components.

   Description:  The value MUST be specified in the UTC time format.

      This property is also useful to protocols such as
      [I-D.ietf-calsify-rfc2447bis] that have inherent latency issues
      with the delivery of content.  This property will assist in the
      proper sequencing of messages containing iCalendar objects.

      In the case of an iCalendar object that specifies a &quot;METHOD&quot;
      property, this property differs from the &quot;CREATED&quot; and &quot;LAST-
      MODIFIED&quot; properties.  These two properties are used to specify
      when the particular calendar data in the calendar store was
      created and last modified.  This is different than when the
      iCalendar object representation of the calendar service
      information was created or last modified.

      In the case of an iCalendar object that doesn't specify a &quot;METHOD&quot;
      property, this property is equivalent to the &quot;LAST-MODIFIED&quot;
      property.

3.8.7.3. Last Modified
</p>
<pre>
   Property Name:  LAST-MODIFIED

   Purpose:  This property specifies the date and time that the
      information associated with the calendar component was last
      revised in the calendar store.

         Note: This is analogous to the modification date and time for a
         file in the file system.

   Value Type:  DATE-TIME

   Property Parameters:  IANA and non-standard property parameters can
      be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified in the &quot;VEVENT&quot;,
      &quot;VTODO&quot;, &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; or &quot;VTIMEZONE&quot; calendar components.

   Description:  The property value MUST be specified in the UTC time
      format.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        last-mod   = &quot;LAST-MODIFIED&quot; lstparam &quot;:&quot; date-time CRLF

3.8.7.4. Sequence Number
</p>
<pre>
   Property Name:  SEQUENCE

   Purpose:  This property defines the revision sequence number of the
      calendar component within a sequence of revisions.

   Value Type:  INTEGER

   Property Parameters:  IANA and non-standard property parameters can
      be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  The property can be specified in &quot;VEVENT&quot;, &quot;VTODO&quot; or
      &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; calendar component.

   Description:  When a calendar component is created, its sequence
      number is zero (US-ASCII decimal 48).  It is monotonically
      incremented by the &quot;Organizer's&quot; CUA each time the &quot;Organizer&quot;
      makes a significant revision to the calendar component.

      The &quot;Organizer&quot; includes this property in an iCalendar object that
      it sends to an &quot;Attendee&quot; to specify the current version of the
      calendar component.

      The &quot;Attendee&quot; includes this property in an iCalendar object that
      it sends to the &quot;Organizer&quot; to specify the version of the calendar
      component that the &quot;Attendee&quot; is referring to.

      A change to the sequence number is not the mechanism that an
      &quot;Organizer&quot; uses to request a response from the &quot;Attendees&quot;.  The
      &quot;RSVP&quot; parameter on the &quot;ATTENDEE&quot; property is used by the
      &quot;Organizer&quot; to indicate that a response from the &quot;Attendees&quot; is
      requested.

      Recurrence instances of a recurring component MAY have different
      sequence numbers.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        seq = &quot;SEQUENCE&quot; seqparam &quot;:&quot; integer CRLF
        ; Default is &quot;0&quot;

        seqparam   = *(&quot;;&quot; other-param)

3.8.8. Miscellaneous Component Properties
</p>
<pre>
   The following properties specify information about a number of
   miscellaneous features of calendar components.
</pre>
<p>
3.8.8.1. IANA Properties
</p>
<pre>
   Property Name:  An IANA registered property name

   Value Type:  The default value type is TEXT.  The value type can be
      set to any value type.

   Property Parameters:  Any parameter can be specified on this
      property.

   Description:  This specification allows other properties registered
      with IANA to be specified in any calendar components.  Compliant
      applications are expected to be able to parse these other IANA
      registered properties but can ignore them.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        iana-prop = iana-token *(&quot;;&quot; icalparameter) &quot;:&quot; value CRLF

   Example:  The following are examples of properties that might be
      registered to IANA:

        DRESSCODE:CASUAL

        NON-SMOKING;VALUE=BOOLEAN:TRUE
</pre>
<p>
3.8.8.2. Non-standard Properties
</p>
<p>
Desruisseaux Expires May 4, 2009 [Page 142]
</p>
<p>
Internet-Draft iCalendar October 2008
</p>
<pre>
   Property Name:  Any property name with a &quot;X-&quot; prefix

   Purpose:  This class of property provides a framework for defining
      non-standard properties.

   Value Type:  The default value type is TEXT.  The value type can be
      set to any value type.

   Property Parameters:  IANA, non-standard and language property
      parameters can be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified in any calendar
      component.

   Description:  The MIME Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type
      provides a &quot;standard mechanism for doing non-standard things&quot;.
      This extension support is provided for implementers to &quot;push the
      envelope&quot; on the existing version of the memo.  Extension
      properties are specified by property and/or property parameter
      names that have the prefix text of &quot;X-&quot; (the two character
      sequence: LATIN CAPITAL LETTER X character followed by the HYPHEN-
      MINUS character).  It is recommended that vendors concatenate onto
      this sentinel another short prefix text to identify the vendor.
      This will facilitate readability of the extensions and minimize
      possible collision of names between different vendors.  User
      agents that support this content type are expected to be able to
      parse the extension properties and property parameters but can
      ignore them.

      At present, there is no registration authority for names of
      extension properties and property parameters.  The value type for
      this property is TEXT.  Optionally, the value type can be any of
      the other valid value types.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        x-prop = x-name *(&quot;;&quot; icalparameter) &quot;:&quot; value CRLF

   Example:  The following might be the ABC vendor's extension for an
      audio-clip form of subject property:

        X-ABC-MMSUBJ;VALUE=URI;FMTTYPE=audio/basic:http://www.example.
         org/mysubj.au

3.8.8.3. Request Status
</p>
<pre>
   Property Name:  REQUEST-STATUS

   Purpose:  This property defines the status code returned for a
      scheduling request.

   Value Type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  IANA, non-standard and language property
      parameters can be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  The property can be specified in &quot;VEVENT&quot;, &quot;VTODO&quot;,
      &quot;VJOURNAL&quot; or &quot;VFREEBUSY&quot; calendar component.

   Description:  This property is used to return status code information
      related to the processing of an associated iCalendar object.  The
      value type for this property is TEXT.

      The value consists of a short return status component, a longer
      return status description component, and optionally a status-
      specific data component.  The components of the value are
      separated by the SEMICOLON character (US-ASCII decimal 59).

      The short return status is a PERIOD character (US-ASCII decimal
      46) separated pair or 3-tuple of integers.  For example, &quot;3.1&quot; or
      &quot;3.1.1&quot;.  The successive levels of integers provide for a
      successive level of status code granularity.

      The following are initial classes for the return status code.
      Individual iCalendar object methods will define specific return
      status codes for these classes.  In addition, other classes for
      the return status code may be defined using the registration
      process defined later in this memo.

   +--------+----------------------------------------------------------+
   | Short  | Longer Return Status Description                         |
   | Return |                                                          |
   | Status |                                                          |
   | Code   |                                                          |
   +--------+----------------------------------------------------------+
   | 1.xx   | Preliminary success.  This class of status code          |
   |        | indicates that the request has been initially processed  |
   |        | but that completion is pending.                          |
   |        |                                                          |

   | 2.xx   | Successful.  This class of status code indicates that    |
   |        | the request was completed successfuly.  However, the     |
   |        | exact status code can indicate that a fallback has been  |
   |        | taken.                                                   |
   |        |                                                          |
   | 3.xx   | Client Error.  This class of status code indicates that  |
   |        | the request was not successful.  The error is the result |
   |        | of either a syntax or a semantic error in the client     |
   |        | formatted request.  Request should not be retried until  |
   |        | the condition in the request is corrected.               |
   |        |                                                          |
   | 4.xx   | Scheduling Error.  This class of status code indicates   |
   |        | that the request was not successful.  Some sort of error |
   |        | occurred within the calendaring and scheduling service,  |
   |        | not directly related to the request itself.              |
   +--------+----------------------------------------------------------+

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

        rstatus    = &quot;REQUEST-STATUS&quot; rstatparam &quot;:&quot;
                     statcode &quot;;&quot; statdesc [&quot;;&quot; extdata]

<ol>
<li>Recommended Practices

</li>
</ol>
<pre>
   These recommended practices should be followed in order to assure
   consistent handling of the following cases for an iCalendar object.

   1.  Content lines longer than 75 octets SHOULD be folded.

   2.  When the combination of the &quot;RRULE&quot; and &quot;RDATE&quot; properties in a
       recurring component produces multiple instances having the same
       start DATE-TIME value, they should be collapsed to, and
       considered as, a single instance.  If the &quot;RDATE&quot; property is
       specified as a PERIOD value the duration of the recurrence
       instance will be the one specified by the &quot;RDATE&quot; property, and
       not the duration of the recurrence instance defined by the
       &quot;DTSTART&quot; property.

   3.  When a calendar user receives multiple requests for the same
       calendar component (e.g., REQUEST for a &quot;VEVENT&quot; calendar
       component) as a result of being on multiple mailing lists
       specified by &quot;ATTENDEE&quot; properties in the request, they SHOULD
       respond to only one of the requests.  The calendar user SHOULD
       also specify (using the &quot;MEMBER&quot; parameter of the &quot;ATTENDEE&quot;
       property) which mailing list they are a member of.

   4.  An implementation can truncate a &quot;SUMMARY&quot; property value to 255
       octets, but MUST NOT truncate the value in the middle of a UTF-8
       multi-octet sequence.

   5.  If seconds of the minute are not supported by an implementation,
       then a value of &quot;00&quot; SHOULD be specified for the seconds
       component in a time value.

   6.  &quot;TZURL&quot; values SHOULD NOT be specified as a file URI type.  This
       URI form can be useful within an organization, but is problematic
       in the Internet.

   7.  Some possible English values for &quot;CATEGORIES&quot; property include
       &quot;ANNIVERSARY&quot;, &quot;APPOINTMENT&quot;, &quot;BUSINESS&quot;, &quot;EDUCATION&quot;, &quot;HOLIDAY&quot;,
       &quot;MEETING&quot;, &quot;MISCELLANEOUS&quot;, &quot;NON-WORKING HOURS&quot;, &quot;NOT IN OFFICE&quot;,
       &quot;PERSONAL&quot;, &quot;PHONE CALL&quot;, &quot;SICK DAY&quot;, &quot;SPECIAL OCCASION&quot;,
       &quot;TRAVEL&quot;, &quot;VACATION&quot;.  Categories can be specified in any
       registered language.

   8.  Some possible English values for &quot;RESOURCES&quot; property include
       &quot;CATERING&quot;, &quot;CHAIRS&quot;, &quot;COMPUTER PROJECTOR&quot;, &quot;EASEL&quot;, &quot;OVERHEAD
       PROJECTOR&quot;, &quot;SPEAKER PHONE&quot;, &quot;TABLE&quot;, &quot;TV&quot;, &quot;VCR&quot;, &quot;VIDEO PHONE&quot;,
       &quot;VEHICLE&quot;.  Resources can be specified in any registered
       language.

<li>Security Considerations

</li>
</ol>
<pre>
   Because calendaring and scheduling information is very privacy-
   sensitive, the protocol used for the transmission of calendaring and
   scheduling information should have capabilities to protect the
   information from possible threats, such as eavesdropping, replay,
   message insertion, deletion, modification and man-in-the-middle
   attacks.

   As this document only defines the data format and media type of text/
   calendar that is independent of any calendar service or protocol, it
   is up to the actual protocol specifications such as iTIP
   [I-D.ietf-calsify-2446bis], iMIP [I-D.ietf-calsify-rfc2447bis], and
   CalDAV [RFC4791] to describe the threats that the above attacks
   present, as well as ways in which to mitigate them.

8.1. iCalendar Media Type Registration
</p>
<pre>
   The Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification is intended
   for use as a MIME content type.

   To: ietf-types@iana.org
   Subject: Registration of media type text/calendar

   Type name:  text

   Subtype name:  calendar

   Required parameters:  none

   Optional parameters:  charset, method, component and optinfo

      The &quot;charset&quot; parameter is defined in [RFC2046] for subtypes of
      the &quot;text&quot; media type.  It is used to indicate the charset used in
      the body part.  The charset supported by this revision of
      iCalendar is UTF-8.  The use of any other charset is deprecated by
      this revision of iCalendar; however note that this revision
      requires that compliant applications MUST accept iCalendar streams
      using either the UTF-8 or US-ASCII charset.

      The &quot;method&quot; parameter is used to convey the iCalendar object
      method or transaction semantics for the calendaring and scheduling
      information.  It also is an identifier for the restricted set of
      properties and values that the iCalendar object consists of.  The
      parameter is to be used as a guide for applications interpreting
      the information contained within the body part.  It SHOULD NOT be
      used to exclude or require particular pieces of information unless
      the identified method definition specifically calls for this
      behavior.  Unless specifically forbidden by a particular method
      definition, a text/calendar content type can contain any set of
      properties permitted by the Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object
      Specification.  The &quot;method&quot; parameter MUST be specified and MUST
      be set to the same value as the &quot;METHOD&quot; component property of the
      iCalendar objects of the iCalendar stream if and only if the
      iCalendar objects in the iCalendar stream all have a &quot;METHOD&quot;
      component property set to the same value.

      The value for the &quot;method&quot; parameter is defined as follows:

        method  = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / &quot;-&quot;)
        ; IANA registered iCalendar object method
</pre>
<p>
Desruisseaux Expires May 4, 2009 [Page 155]
</p>
<p>
Internet-Draft iCalendar October 2008
</p>
<pre>
      The &quot;component&quot; parameter conveys the type of iCalendar calendar
      component within the body part.  If the iCalendar object contains
      more than one calendar component type, then multiple component
      parameters MUST be specified.

      The value for the &quot;component&quot; parameter is defined as follows:

        component = &quot;VEVENT&quot;
                  / &quot;VTODO&quot;
                  / &quot;VJOURNAL&quot;
                  / &quot;VFREEBUSY&quot;
                  / &quot;VTIMEZONE&quot;
                  / iana-token
                  / x-name

      The &quot;optinfo&quot; parameter conveys optional information about the
      iCalendar object within the body part.  This parameter can only
      specify semantics already specified by the iCalendar object and
      that can be otherwise determined by parsing the body part.  In
      addition, the optional information specified by this parameter
      MUST be consistent with that information specified by the
      iCalendar object.  For example, it can be used to convey the
      &quot;Attendee&quot; response status to a meeting request.  The parameter
      value consists of a string value.

      The parameter can be specified multiple times.

      The value for the &quot;optinfo&quot; parameter is defined as follows:

        optinfo    = infovalue / qinfovalue

        infovalue  = iana-token / x-name

        qinfovalue = DQUOTE (infovalue) DQUOTE

   Encoding considerations:  This media type can contain 8bit
      characters, so the use of quoted-printable or base64 MIME Content-
      Transfer-Encodings might be necessary when iCalendar objects are
      transferred across protocols restricted to the 7bit repertoire.
      Note that a text valued property in the content entity can also
      have content encoding of special characters using a BACKSLASH
      character (US-ASCII decimal 92) escapement technique.  This means
      that content values can end up encoded twice.

   Security considerations:  See Section 7.

<pre>
   Interoperability considerations:  This media type is intended to
      define a common format for conveying calendaring and scheduling
      information between different systems.  It is heavily based on the
      earlier [VCAL] industry specification.

   Published specification:  This specification.

   Applications which use this media type:  This media type is designed
      for widespread use by Internet calendaring and scheduling
      applications.  In addition, applications in the workflow and
      document management area might find this content-type applicable.
      The iTIP [I-D.ietf-calsify-2446bis], iMIP
      [I-D.ietf-calsify-rfc2447bis] and CalDAV [RFC4791] Internet
      protocols directly use this media type also.

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s):  None.

      File extension(s):  The file extension of &quot;ics&quot; is to be used to
         designate a file containing (an arbitrary set of) calendaring
         and scheduling information consistent with this MIME content
         type.

         The file extension of &quot;ifb&quot; is to be used to designate a file
         containing free or busy time information consistent with this
         MIME content type.

      Macintosh file type code(s):  The file type code of &quot;iCal&quot; is to
         be used in Apple MacIntosh operating system environments to
         designate a file containing calendaring and scheduling
         information consistent with this MIME media type.

         The file type code of &quot;iFBf&quot; is to be used in Apple MacIntosh
         operating system environments to designate a file containing
         free or busy time information consistent with this MIME media
         type.

   Person &amp; email address to contact for further information:  See the
      &quot;Author's Address&quot; section of this document.

   Intended usage:  COMMON

   Restrictions on usage:  There are no restrictions on where this media
      type can be used.

8.2. New iCalendar Elements Registration
</p>
<pre>
   This section defines the process to register new or modified
   iCalendar elements, that is, components, properties, parameters,
   value data types, and values, with IANA.
</pre>
<p>
8.2.1. iCalendar Elements Registration Procedure
</p>
<pre>
   The IETF will create a mailing list, icalendar@ietf.org [2], which
   can be used for public discussion of iCalendar elements proposals
   prior to registration.  Use of the mailing list is strongly
   encouraged.  The IESG will appoint a designated expert who will
   monitor the icalendar@ietf.org [2] mailing list and review
   registrations.

   Registration of new iCalendar elements MUST be reviewed by the
   designated expert and published in an RFC.  A Standard Tracks RFC is
   REQUIRED for the regisration of new value data types that modify
   existing properties, as well as for the registration of participation
   statuses values to be used in &quot;VEVENT&quot; calendar components.  A
   Standard Tracks RFC is also REQUIRED for registration of iCalendar
   elements that modify iCalendar elements previously documented in a
   Standard Tracks RFC.

   The registration procedure begins when a completed registration
   template, defined in the sections below, is sent to
   icalendar@ietf.org [2] and iana@iana.org [3].  The designated expert
   is expected to tell IANA and the submitter of the registration within
   two weeks whether the registration is approved, approved with minor
   changes, or rejected with cause.  When a registration is rejected
   with cause, it can be re-submitted if the concerns listed in the
   cause are addressed.  Decisions made by the designated expert can be
   appealed to the IESG Applications Area Director, then to the IESG.
   They follow the normal appeals procedure for IESG decisions.

h1. RiCal


h2. What

RiCal is a new Ruby Library for parsing, generating, and using iCalendar (RFC 2445) format data.

h2. Installing

<pre syntax="ruby">sudo gem install ri_cal</pre>

h2. The basics

RiCal distinguishes itself from existing Ruby libraries in providing support for

* Timezone components in Calendars.  This means that RiCal parses VTIMEZONE data and instantiates timezone objects
which can be used to convert times in the calendar to and from UTC time.  In addition, RiCal allows created calendars
and components to use time zones understood by TZInfo gem (from either the TZInfo gem or from Rails ActiveSupport => 2.2). 
When a calendar with TZInfo time zones is exported, RFC 2445 conforming VTIMEZONE components will be included, allowing
other programs to process the result.

* Enumeration of recurring occurrences. For example, if an Event has one or more recurrence rules, then the occurrences 
of the event can be enumerated as a series of Event occurrences.

h2. Demonstration of usage

RiCal provides a builder DSL for creating calendars and calendar components. An example

  RiCal.Calendar do
    event do
      description "MA-6 First US Manned Spaceflight"
      dtstart     DateTime.parse("2/20/1962 14:47:39")
      dtend       DateTime.parse("2/20/1962 19:43:02")
      location    "Cape Canaveral"
      add_attendee "john.glenn@nasa.gov"
      alarm do
        description "Segment 51"
      end
    end
  end
  
The blocks are evaluated in the context of an object which builds the calendar or calendar component. method names
starting with add_ or remove_ are sent to the component, method names which correspond to a property value setter of
the object being built will cause that setter to be sent to the component with the provided value.

A method corresponding to the name of one of the components sub component will create the sub component and 
evaluate the block in the context of the new subcomponent.

TODO - You can not created a RubyForge project, OR have not run <code>rubyforge config</code>
yet to refresh your local rubyforge data with this projects' id information.

When you do this, this message will magically disappear!

Or you can hack website/index.txt and make it all go away!!

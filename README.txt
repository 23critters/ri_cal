== DESCRIPTION:

A new Ruby implementation of RFC2445 iCalendar.

The existing Ruby iCalendar libraries (e.g. icalendar, vpim) provide for parsing and generating icalendar files,
but do not support important things like enumerating occurrences of repeating events.

This is a clean-slate implementation of RFC2445.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* All examples of recurring events in RFC 2445 are handled. RSpec examples are provided for them. 

== SYNOPSIS:

  FIXME (code sample of usage)

== REQUIREMENTS:

* FIXME (list of requirements)

== INSTALL:

* FIXME (sudo gem install, anything else)

== LICENSE:
